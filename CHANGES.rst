Borg Changelog
==============


Version 0.24.0
--------------

Incompatible changes (compared to 0.23):

- borg now always issues --umask NNN option when invoking another borg via ssh
  on the repository server. By that, it's making sure it uses the same umask
  for remote repos as for local ones. Because of this, you must upgrade both
  server and client(s) to 0.24.
- the default umask is 077 now (if you do not specify via --umask) which might
  be a different one as you used previously. The default umask avoids that
  you accidentally give access permissions for group and/or others to files
  created by borg (e.g. the repository).

Deprecations:

- "--encryption passphrase" mode is deprecated, see #85 and #97.
  See the new "--encryption repokey" mode for a replacement.

New features:

- borg create --chunker-params ... to configure the chunker, fixes #16
  (attic #302, attic #300, and somehow also #41).
  This can be used to reduce memory usage caused by chunk management overhead,
  so borg does not create a huge chunks index/repo index and eats all your RAM
  if you back up lots of data in huge files (like VM disk images).
  See docs/misc/create_chunker-params.txt for more information.
- borg info now reports chunk counts in the chunk index.
- borg create --compression 0..9 to select zlib compression level, fixes #66
  (attic #295).
- borg init --encryption repokey (to store the encryption key into the repo),
  fixes #85
- improve at-end error logging, always log exceptions and set exit_code=1
- LoggedIO: better error checks / exceptions / exception handling
- implement --remote-path to allow non-default-path borg locations, #125
- implement --umask M and use 077 as default umask for better security, #117
- borg check: give a named single archive to it, fixes #139
- cache sync: show progress indication
- cache sync: reimplement the chunk index merging in C

Bug fixes:

- fix segfault that happened for unreadable files (chunker: n needs to be a
  signed size_t), #116
- fix the repair mode, #144
- repo delete: add destroy to allowed rpc methods, fixes issue #114
- more compatible repository locking code (based on mkdir), maybe fixes #92
  (attic #317, attic #201).
- better Exception msg if no Borg is installed on the remote repo server, #56
- create a RepositoryCache implementation that can cope with >2GiB,
  fixes attic #326.
- fix Traceback when running check --repair, attic #232
- clarify help text, fixes #73.
- add help string for --no-files-cache, fixes #140

Other changes:

- improved docs:

  - added docs/misc directory for misc. writeups that won't be included
    "as is" into the html docs.
  - document environment variables and return codes (attic #324, attic #52)
  - web site: add related projects, fix web site url, IRC #borgbackup

  - document what borg check does, fixes #138
  - reorganize borgbackup.github.io sidebar, prev/next at top
  - deduplicate and refactor the docs / README.rst

- use borg-tmp as prefix for temporary files / directories
- short prune options without "keep-" are deprecated, do not suggest them
- improved tox configuration
- remove usage of unittest.mock, always use mock from pypi
- use entrypoints instead of scripts, for better use of the wheel format and
  modern installs
- add requirements.d/development.txt and modify tox.ini
- use travis-ci for testing based on Linux and (new) OS X
- use coverage.py, pytest-cov and codecov.io for test coverage support

I forgot to list some stuff already implemented in 0.23.0, here they are:

New features:

- efficient archive list from manifest, meaning a big speedup for slow
  repo connections and "list <repo>", "delete <repo>", "prune" (attic #242,
  attic #167)
- big speedup for chunks cache sync (esp. for slow repo connections), fixes #18
- hashindex: improve error messages

Other changes:

- explicitly specify binary mode to open binary files
- some easy micro optimizations


Version 0.23.0
--------------

Incompatible changes (compared to attic, fork related):

- changed sw name and cli command to "borg", updated docs
- package name (and name in urls) uses "borgbackup" to have less collisions
- changed repo / cache internal magic strings from ATTIC* to BORG*,
  changed cache location to .cache/borg/ - this means that it currently won't
  accept attic repos (see issue #21 about improving that)

Bug fixes:

- avoid defect python-msgpack releases, fixes attic #171, fixes attic #185

- give specific path to xattr.is_enabled(), disable symlink setattr call that
  always fails
- fix test setup for 32bit platforms, partial fix for attic #196
- upgraded versioneer, PEP440 compliance, fixes attic #257

New features:

- less memory usage: add global option --no-cache-files
- check --last N (only check the last N archives)
- check: sort archives in reverse time order
- rename repo::oldname newname (rename repository)
- create -v output more informative
- create --progress (backup progress indicator)
- create --timestamp (utc string or reference file/dir)
- create: if "-" is given as path, read binary from stdin
- extract: if --stdout is given, write all extracted binary data to stdout
- extract --sparse (simple sparse file support)
- extra debug information for 'fread failed'
- delete <repo> (deletes whole repo + local cache)
- FUSE: reflect deduplication in allocated blocks
- only allow whitelisted RPC calls in server mode
- normalize source/exclude paths before matching
- use posix_fadvise to not spoil the OS cache, fixes attic #252

- source: refactor indicator (status) and item processing
- source: use py.test for better testing, flake8 for code style checks
- source: fix tox >=2.0 compatibility (test runner)
- pypi package: add python version classifiers, add FreeBSD to platforms
