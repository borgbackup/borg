# stuff we need to include into the sdist is handled automatically by
# setuptools_scm - it includes all git-committed files.
# but we want to exclude some committed files/dirs not needed in the sdist:
exclude .editorconfig .gitattributes .gitignore .mailmap Vagrantfile
prune .github

include src/borg/platform/windows.c
# stuff we need to copy to successfully run testsuite. setuptool_scm includes all git-committed files, but we don't have .git directory in
# debian, since we rely on github tarballs.
include src/borg/testsuite/attic.tar.gz
# stuff we need on the system required by keymanager.py
