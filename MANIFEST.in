# Files to include into the sdist are handled automatically by
# setuptools_scm — it includes all Git-committed files.
# But we want to exclude some committed files/dirs not needed in the sdist:
exclude .editorconfig .gitattributes .gitignore .mailmap Vagrantfile
prune .github
include src/borg/platform/darwin.c src/borg/platform/freebsd.c src/borg/platform/linux.c src/borg/platform/posix.c
include src/borg/platform/syncfilerange.c
include src/borg/platform/windows.c
