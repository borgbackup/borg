What is Borg?
-------------
Borg is a deduplicating backup program. The main goal of Borg is to provide
an efficient and secure way to backup data. The data deduplication
technique used makes Borg suitable for daily backups since only changes
are stored.

Borg is a fork of Attic and maintained by "The Borg Collective" (see AUTHORS file).

BORG IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ORIGINAL ATTIC.
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, EXPECT THAT WE WILL BREAK COMPATIBILITY REPEATEDLY.
THIS IS SOFTWARE IN DEVELOPMENT, DECIDE YOURSELF IF IT FITS YOUR NEEDS.

Read issue #1 on the issue tracker, goals are being defined there.

Please also see the LICENSE for more informations.

Easy to use
~~~~~~~~~~~
Initialize backup repository and create a backup archive::

    $ borg init /mnt/backup
    $ borg create -v /mnt/backup::documents ~/Documents

Main features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Space efficient storage
  Variable block size deduplication is used to reduce the number of bytes 
  stored by detecting redundant data. Each file is split into a number of
  variable length chunks and only chunks that have never been seen before are
  compressed and added to the repository.

Optional data encryption
    All data can be protected using 256-bit AES encryption and data integrity
    and authenticity is verified using a MAC (message authentication code).

Off-site backups
    Borg can store data on any remote host accessible over SSH.  This is
    most efficient if Borg is also installed on the remote host.

Backups mountable as filesystems
    Backup archives are mountable as userspace filesystems for easy backup
    verification and restores.

What do I need?
---------------
Borg requires Python 3.2 or above to work.
Borg also requires a sufficiently recent OpenSSL (>= 1.0.0).
In order to mount archives as filesystems, llfuse is required.
For other python requirements, please see setup.py install_requires.

How do I install it?
--------------------
::

  $ pip3 install borgbackup

Where are the docs?
-------------------
Go to https://borgbackup.github.io/ for a prebuilt version of the documentation.
You can also build it yourself from the docs folder.

Where are the tests?
--------------------
The tests are in the borg/testsuite package. To run the test suite use the
following command::

  $ fakeroot -u tox  # you need to have tox installed
