What is BorgBackup?
-------------------
BorgBackup (short: Borg) is a deduplicating backup program.
Optionally, it supports compression and authenticated encryption.

The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to backup data.
The data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable for daily backups
since only changes are stored.
The authenticated encryption technique makes it suitable for backups to not
fully trusted targets.

Main features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Space efficient storage**
  Deduplication based on content-defined chunking is used to reduce the number
  of bytes stored: each file is split into a number of variable length chunks
  and only chunks that have never been seen before are added to the repository.

  To deduplicate, all the chunks in the same repository are considered, no
  matter whether they come from different machines, from previous backups,
  from the same backup or even from the same single file.

  Compared to other deduplication approaches, this method does NOT depend on:

  * file/directory names staying the same

    So you can move your stuff around without killing the deduplication,
    even between machines sharing a repo.

  * complete files or time stamps staying the same

    If a big file changes a little, only a few new chunks will be stored -
    this is great for VMs or raw disks.

  * the absolute position of a data chunk inside a file

    Stuff may get shifted and will still be found by the deduplication
    algorithm.

**Speed**
  * performance critical code (chunking, compression, encryption) is
    implemented in C/Cython
  * local caching of files/chunks index data
  * quick detection of unmodified files

**Data encryption**
    All data can be protected using 256-bit AES encryption, data integrity and
    authenticity is verified using HMAC-SHA256.

**Compression**
    All data can be compressed by zlib, level 0-9.

**Off-site backups**
    Borg can store data on any remote host accessible over SSH.  If Borg is
    installed on the remote host, big performance gains can be achieved
    compared to using a network filesystem (sshfs, nfs, ...).

**Backups mountable as filesystems**
    Backup archives are mountable as userspace filesystems for easy interactive
    backup examination and restores (e.g. by using a regular file manager).

**Platforms Borg works on**
  * Linux
  * FreeBSD
  * Mac OS X
  * Cygwin (unsupported)

**Free and Open Source Software**
  * security and functionality can be audited independently
  * licensed under the BSD (3-clause) license


Easy to use
~~~~~~~~~~~
Initialize a new backup repository and create a backup archive::

    $ borg init /mnt/backup
    $ borg create /mnt/backup::Monday ~/Documents

Now doing another backup, just to show off the great deduplication::

    $ borg create --stats /mnt/backup::Tuesday ~/Documents
