"""logging facilities

The way to use this is as follows:

* each module declares its own logger, using:

    from .logger import create_logger
    logger = create_logger()

* then each module uses logger.info/warning/debug/etc according to the
  level it believes is appropriate:

    logger.debug('some intricate details you usually do not care about')
    logger.info('verbose progress information')
    logger.warning('some non-error condition that must always be reported')
    logger.error('a fatal error')

  ... and so on. see the `logging documentation
  <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#when-to-use-logging>`_
  for more information

* console interaction happens on stderr, that includes interactive
  reporting functions like `help`, `info` and `list`

* ...except ``input()`` is special, because we can't control the
  stream it is using, unfortunately. we assume that it won't clutter
  stdout, because interaction would be broken then anyways

* advanced verbosity filters, based on what i described in
  https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/pull/233#issuecomment-145100222
  may eventually be implemented
