Upgrade Notes
=============

borg 1.2.x/1.4.x to borg 2.0
----------------------------

Compatibility notes:

- this is a major "breaking" release that is not compatible with existing repos.

  We tried to put all the necessary "breaking" changes into this release, so we
  hopefully do not need another breaking release in the near future. The changes
  were necessary for improved security, improved speed and parallelism,
  unblocking future improvements, getting rid of legacy crap and design
  limitations, having less and simpler code to maintain.

  You can use "borg transfer" to transfer archives from borg 1.2/1.4 repos to
  a new borg 2.0 repo, but it will need some time and space.

  Before using "borg transfer", you must have upgraded to borg >= 1.2.6 (or
  another borg version that was patched to fix CVE-2023-CVE-2023-36811) and
  you must have followed the upgrade instructions at top of the change log
  relating to manifest and archive TAMs (borg2 just requires these TAMs now).

- command line syntax was changed, scripts and wrappers will need changes:

  - you will usually either export BORG_REPO=<MYREPO> into your environment or
    call borg like: "borg -r <MYREPO> <COMMAND>".
    in the docs, we usually omit "-r ..." for brevity.
  - the scp-style REPO syntax was removed, please use ssh://..., #6697
  - ssh:// URLs: removed support for /~otheruser/, /~/ and /./, #6855.
    New format:

    - ssh://user@host:port/relative/path
    - ssh://user@host:port//absolute/path
  - -P / --prefix option was removed, please use the similar -a / --match-archives.
  - archive names don't need to be unique anymore. to the contrary:
    it is now strongly recommended to use the identical name for borg create
    within the same series of archives to make borg work more efficiently.
    the name now identifies a series of archive, to identify a single archive
    please use aid:<archive-hash-prefix>, e.g.: borg delete aid:d34db33f
  - in case you do NOT want to adopt the "series name" way of naming archives
    (like "myarchive") as we recommend, but keep using always-changing names
    (like "myserver-myarchive-20241231"), you can do that, but then you must
    make use of BORG_FILES_CACHE_SUFFIX and either set it to a constant suffix
    (like "all") or to a unique suffix per archive series (like
    "myserver-myarchive") so that borg can find the correct files cache.
    For the "all" variant, you must also set BORG_FILES_CACHE_TTL to a value
    greater than the count of different archives series you write to that repo.
    Usually borg uses a different files cache suffix per archive (series) name
    and defaults to BORG_FILES_CACHE_TTL=2 because that is sufficient for that.
  - the archive id is always given separately from the repository
    (differently than with borg 1.x you must not give repo::archive).
  - the series name or archive id is either given as a positional parameter,
    like:

    - borg create documents ~/Documents
    - borg diff aid:deadbeef aid:d34db33f
  - or, if the command makes sense for an arbitrary amount of archives, archives
    can be selected using a glob pattern, like:

    - borg delete -a 'sh:myarchive-2024-??-??'
    - borg recreate -a 'sh:myarchive-2024-??-??'
  - some borg 1.x commands that supported working on a repo AND on an archive
    were split into 2 commands, some others were renamed:

    - borg 2 repo commands:

      - borg repo-create  # was: borg init
      - borg repo-list
      - borg repo-info
      - borg repo-delete
      - borg repo-compress
      - borg repo-space
    - borg 2 archive commands:

      - borg create NAME ...
      - borg list ID
      - borg extract ID ...
      - borg diff ID1 ID2
      - borg rename ID NEWNAME
      - borg info ID
      - borg delete ID
      - borg recreate ID ...
      - borg mount -a ID mountpoint ...

    For more details, please consult the docs or --help option output.
  - create/recreate/import-tar --timestamp: defaults to local timezone
    now (was: UTC)
- some deprecated options were removed:

  - removed --remote-ratelimit (use --upload-ratelimit)
  - removed --numeric-owner (use --numeric-ids)
  - removed --nobsdflags (use --noflags)
  - removed --noatime (default now, see also --atime)
  - removed --save-space option (does not change behaviour)
- removed --bypass-lock option
- removed borg config command (only worked locally anyway)
- compact command now requires access to the borg key if the repo is encrypted
  or authenticated
- using --list together with --progress is now disallowed (except with --log-json), #7219
- the --glob-archives option was renamed to --match-archives (the short option
  name -a is unchanged) and extended to support different pattern styles:

  - id: for identical string match (this is the new default!)
  - sh: for shell pattern / globbing match (this was used by --glob-archives)
  - re: for regular expression match

  So you might need to edit your scripts like e.g.::

      borg 1.x: --glob-archives 'myserver-2024-*'
      borg 2.0: --match-archives 'sh:myserver-2024-*'

- use platformdirs 3.x.x instead of home-grown code. Due to that:

  - XDG_*_HOME is not honoured on macOS and on Windows.
  - BORG_BASE_DIR can still be used to enforce some base dir + .config/ or .cache/.
  - the default macOS config and cache dir will now be in ~/Library/Application Support/borg/.
- create: different included/excluded status chars, #7321

  - dry-run: now uses "+" (was: "-") and "-" (was: "x") for included/excluded status
  - non-dry-run: now uses "-" (was: "x") for excluded files

  Option --filter=... might need an update, if you filter for the status chars
  that were changed.
- borg is now more strict and disallows giving some options multiple times -
  if that makes no sense. Highlander options, see #6269. That might make scripts
  fail now that somehow "worked" before (but maybe didn't work as intended due to
  the contradicting options).

  borg won't delete/prune/recreate protected archives.
- prune: add quarterly pruning strategy, #8337.
- import-tar/export-tar: add xattr support for PAX format, #2521.

  - chunks index: show hashtable stats at debug log level, #506.
- check (repository part): build and cache a ChunkIndex.

  check (archives part): use cached ChunkIndex from check (repository part).
- export-tar: switch default to PAX format.
- docs:

  - update URL docs
  - mount: document on-demand loading, perf tips, #7173.
  - borg/borgfs detects internally under which name it was invoked, #8207.
  - better link modern return codes, #8370.
  - binary: using the directory build is faster, #8008.
  - update "Running the tests (using the pypi package)", #6386.
- github CI:

  - temporarily disabled windows CI, #8474.
  - msys2: use pyinstaller 6.10.0.
  - msys2: install rclone.
- tests:

  - rename test files so that pytest default discovery finds them.
  - call register_assert_rewrite before importing borg.testsuite.
  - move conftest.py one directory level higher.
  - remove hashindex tests from selftests (borghash project has own tests).


Version 2.0.0b12 (2024-10-03)
-----------------------------

New features:

- tag: new command to set, add, remove tags.
- repo-list: add tags/hostname/username/comment to default format, reorder, adjust.

  Idea: not putting these into the archive name, but keeping them separate.
- repo-list --short: only print archive IDs (unique IDs, used for scripting).
- implement --match-archives user:USERNAME host:HOSTNAME tags:TAG1,TAG2,...
- allow -a / --match-archives multiple times (logical AND).

  E.g.: borg delete -a home -a user:kenny -a host:kenny-pc
- analyze: list changed chunks' sizes per directory.

Fixes:

- locking: also refresh the lock in other repo methods. avoid repo lock
  getting stale when processing lots of unchanged files, #8442.
- make sure the store gets closed in case of exceptions, #8413.
- msgpack: increase max_buffer_size to ~4GiB, #8440.
- Location.canonical_path: fix protocol and host display, #8446.

Other changes:

- give borgstore.Store a complete levels configuration, #8432.
- add BORG_STORE_DATA_LEVELS=2 env var.
- check: also display archive timestamp.
- vagrant:

  - use python 3.12.6 for binary builds.
  - new testing box based on bento/ubuntu-24.04.
  - install Rust on BSD.


Version 2.0.0b11 (2024-09-26)
-----------------------------

New features:

- Support rclone:// URLs for borg repositories.

  This enables 70+ cloud storage products, including Amazon S3, Backblaze B2,
  Ceph, Dropbox, ftp(s), Google Cloud Storage, Google Drive, Microsoft Azure,
  Microsoft OneDrive, OpenStack Swift, pCloud, Seafile, sftp, SMB / CIFS and
  WebDAV!

  See https://rclone.org/ for more details.
- Parallel operations in same repo from same client (same user/machine).
- Archive series feature, #7930.

  TL;DR: a NAME now identifies a series of identically named archives,
  to identify a specific single archive, use aid:<archive hash>.

  in borg 1.x, we used to put a timestamp into the archive name, because borg1
  required unique archive names.

  borg2 does not require unique archive names, but it encourages you to even
  use a identical archive names within the same SERIES of archives, e.g. you
  could backup user files to archives named "user-files" and system files to
  archives named "system-files".
  that makes matching (e.g. for prune, for the files cache, ...) much simpler
  and borg now KNOWS which archives belong to the same series (because they all
  have the same name).
- info/delete/prune: allow positional NAME argument, e.g.:

  - borg prune --keep-daily 30 <seriesname>
  - borg delete aid:<archive hash>
- create: also archive inode number, #8362

  Borg can use this when using archive series to rebuild the local files cache
  from the previous archive (of the same series) in the repository.

Fixes:

- Remove superfluous repository.list() call. for high latency repos
  (like sftp, cloud), this improves performance of borg check and compact.
- repository.list: refresh lock more frequently
- misc. commands fixed for non-unique archive names
- remote: allow get_manifest method
- files cache: fix rare race condition with data loss potential, #3536
- storelocking: misc. fixes / cleanups

Other changes:

- Cache the chunks index in the repository, #8397.
  Improves high latency repo performance for most commands compared to b10.
- repo-compress: faster by using chunks index rather than repository.list().
- Files cache entries now have both ctime AND mtime.
- Borg updates the ctime and mtime of known and "unchanged" files, #4915.
- Rebuild files cache from previous archive in same series, #8385.
- Reduce RAM usage by splitting the files cache by archive series, #5658.
- Remove AdHocCache, remove BORG_CACHE_IMPL (we only have one implementation).
- Docs: user@ and :port are optional in sftp and ssh URLs.
- CI: re-enable windows build after fixing it.
- Upgrade pyinstaller to 6.10.0.
- Increase IDS_PER_CHUNK, #6945.


Version 2.0.0b10 (2024-09-09)
-----------------------------

New features:

- borgstore based repository, file:, ssh: and sftp: for now, more possible.
- repository stores objects separately now, not using segment files.
  this has more fs overhead, but needs much less I/O because no segment
  files compaction is required anymore. also, no repository index is
  needed anymore because we can directly find the objects by their ID.
- locking: new borgstore based repository locking with automatic stale
  lock removal (if lock does not get refreshed, if lock owner process is dead).
- simultaneous repository access for many borg commands except check/compact.
  the cache lock for adhocwithfiles is still exclusive though, so use
  BORG_CACHE_IMPL=adhoc if you want to try that out using only 1 machine
  and 1 user (that implementation doesn't use a cache lock). When using
  multiple client machines or users, it also works with the default cache.
- delete/prune: much quicker now and can be undone.
- check --repair --undelete-archives: bring archives back from the dead.
- repo-space: manage reserved space in repository (avoid dead-end situation if
  repository filesystem runs full).

Bugs/issues fixed:

- a lot! all linked from PR #8332.

Other changes:

- repository: remove transactions, solved differently and much simpler now
  (convergence and write order primarily).
- repository: replaced precise reference counting with "object exists in repo?"
  and "garbage collection of unused objects".
- cache: remove transactions, remove chunks cache.
  removed LocalCache, BORG_CACHE_IMPL=local, solving all related issues.
  as in beta 9, adhowwithfiles is the default implementation.
- compact: needs the borg key now (run it clientside), -v gives nice stats.
- transfer: archive transfers from borg 1.x need the --from-borg1 option
- check: reimplemented / bigger changes.
- code: got rid of a metric ton of not needed complexity.
  when borg does not need to read borg 1.x repos/archives anymore, after
  users have transferred their archives, even much more can be removed.
- docs: updated / removed outdated stuff
- renamed r* commands to repo-*


Version 2.0.0b9 (2024-07-20)
----------------------------

New features:

- add BORG_CACHE_IMPL, default is "adhocwithfiles" to test the new cache
  implementation, featuring an adhoc non-persistent chunks cache and a
  persistent files cache. See the docs for other values.

  Requires to run "borg check --repair --archives-only" to delete orphaned
  chunks before running "borg compact" to free space! These orphans are
  expected due to the simplified refcounting with the AdHocFilesCache.
- make BORG_EXIT_CODES="modern" the default, #8110
- add BORG_USE_CHUNKS_ARCHIVE env var, #8280
- automatically rebuild cache on exception, #5213

Bug fixes:

- fix Ctrl-C / SIGINT behaviour for pyinstaller-made binaries, #8155
- delete: fix error handling with Ctrl-C
- rcompress: fix error handling with Ctrl-C
- delete: fix error handling when no archive is specified, #8256
- setup.py: fix import error reporting for cythonize import, see #8208
- create: deal with EBUSY, #8123
- benchmark: inherit options --rsh --remote-path, #8099
- benchmark: fix return value, #8113
- key export: fix crash when no path is given, fix exception handling

Other changes:

- setup.py: detect noexec build fs issue, see #8208
- improve acl_get / acl_set error handling (forward port from 1.4-maint)
- allow msgpack 1.1.0
- vagrant: use pyinstaller 6.7.0
- use Python 3.11.9 for binary builds
- require Cython 3.0.3 at least, #8133
- docs: add non-root deployment strategy


Version 2.0.0b8 (2024-02-20)
----------------------------

New features:

- create: add the slashdot hack, update docs, #4685
- BORG_EXIT_CODES=modern: optional more specific return codes (for errors and warnings).

  The default value of this new environment variable is "legacy", which should result in
  a behaviour similar to borg 1.2 and older (only using rc 0, 1 and 2).
  "modern" exit codes are much more specific (see the internals/frontends docs).
- implement "borg version" (shows client and server version), #7829

Fixes:

- docs: CVE-2023-36811 upgrade steps: consider checkpoint archives, #7802
- check/compact: fix spurious reappearance of orphan chunks since borg 1.2, #6687 -
  this consists of 2 fixes:

  - for existing chunks: check --repair: recreate shadow index, #7897 #6687
  - for newly created chunks: update shadow index when doing a double-put, #7896 #5661

  If you have experienced issue #6687, you may want to run borg check --repair
  after upgrading to borg 1.2.7 to recreate the shadow index and get rid of the
  issue for existing chunks.
- check: fix return code for index entry value discrepancies
- LockRoster.modify: no KeyError if element was already gone, #7937
- create --X-from-command: run subcommands with a clean environment, #7916
- list --sort-by: support "archive" as alias of "name", #7873
- fix rc and msg if arg parsing throws an exception, #7885
- PATH: do not accept empty strings, #4221

- zlib legacy decompress fixes, #7883

Other changes:

- replace archive/manifest TAMs by typed repo objects (ro_type), docs, #7670
- crypto: use a one-step kdf for session keys, #7953
- remove recreate --recompress option, use the more efficient repo-wide "rcompress".
- include unistd.h in _chunker.c (fix for Python 3.13)
- allow msgpack 1.0.7
- allow platformdirs 4, #7950

Version 2.0.0b2 (2022-09-10)
----------------------------

Bug fixes:

- xattrs / extended stat: improve exception handling, #6988
- fix and refactor replace_placeholders, #6966

New features:

- support archive timestamps with utc offsets, adapt them when using
  borg transfer to transfer from borg 1.x repos (append +00:00 for UTC).
- create/recreate/import-tar --timestamp: accept giving timezone via
  its utc offset. defaults to local timezone, if no utc offset is given.

Other changes:

- chunks: have separate encrypted metadata (ctype, clevel, csize, size)

  chunk = enc_meta_len16 + encrypted(msgpacked(meta)) + encrypted(compressed(data)).

  this breaks repo format compatibility, you need to create fresh repos!
- repository api: flags support, #6982
- OpenBSD only - statically link OpenSSL, #6474.
  Avoid conflicting with shared libcrypto from the base OS pulled in via dependencies.
- restructured source code
- update diagrams to odg format, #6928

Version 2.0.0b1 (2022-08-08)
----------------------------

New features:

- massively increase archive metadata stream size limit, #1473.
  currently rather testing the code, scalability will improve later, see #6945.
- rcreate --copy-crypt-key: copy crypt_key from key of other repo, #6710.
  default: create new, random authenticated encryption key.
- prune/delete --checkpoint-interval=1800 and ctrl-c/SIGINT support, #6284

- ctrl-c must not kill important subprocesses, #6912
- transfer: check whether ID hash method and chunker secret are same.
  add PlaintextKey and AuthenticatedKey support to uses_same_id_hash function.
- check: try harder to create the key, #5719
- SaveFile: use a custom mkstemp with mode support, #6933, #6400
- make setuptools happy, #6874
- fix misc. compiler warnings
- list: fix {flags:<WIDTH>} formatting, #6081

Other changes:

- new crypto does not need to call ._assert_id(), update code and docs.
  https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/pull/6463#discussion_r925436156
- check: --verify-data does not need to decompress with new crypto modes
- Key: crypt_key instead of enc_key + enc_hmac_key, #6611
- misc. docs updates and improvements
- CI: test on macOS 12 without fuse / fuse tests
- repository: add debug logging for issue #6687
- _version.py: remove trailing blank, add LF at EOF (make pep8 checker happy)


Version 2.0.0a4 (2022-07-17)
----------------------------

New features:

- recreate: consider level for recompression, #6698, #3622

Other changes:

- stop using libdeflate
- CI: add mypy (if we add type hints, it can do type checking)
- big changes to the source code:

  - split up archiver module, transform it into a package
  - use Black for automated code formatting
  - remove some legacy code
  - adapt/fix code for mypy
- use language_level = 3str for cython (this will be the default in cython 3)
- docs: document HardLinkManager and hlid, #2388


Version 2.0.0a3 (2022-07-04)
----------------------------

Fixes:

- check repo version, accept old repos only for --other-repo (e.g. rcreate/transfer).
  v2 is the default repo version for borg 2.0. v1 repos must only be used in a
  read-only way, e.g. for --other-repo=V1_REPO with borg init and borg transfer!

New features:

- transfer: --upgrader=NoOp is the default.
  This is to support general-purpose transfer of archives between related borg2
  repos.
- transfer: --upgrader=From12To20 must be used to transfer (and convert) archives
  from borg 1.2 repos to borg 2.0 repos.

Other changes:

- removed some deprecated options
- removed -P (aka --prefix) option, #6806. The option -a (aka --glob-archives)
  can be used for same purpose and is more powerful, e.g.: -a 'PREFIX*'
- rcreate: always use argon2 kdf for new repos, #6820
- rcreate: remove legacy encryption modes for new repos, #6490


Version 2.0.0a2 (2022-06-26)
----------------------------

Changes:

- split repo and archive name into separate args, #948

  - use -r or --repo or BORG_REPO env var to give the repository
  - use --other-repo or BORG_OTHER_REPO to give another repo (e.g. borg transfer)
  - use positional argument for archive name or `-a ARCH_GLOB`
- remove support for scp-style repo specification, use ssh://...
- simplify stats output: repo ops -> repo stats, archive ops -> archive stats
- repository index: add payload size (==csize) and flags to NSIndex entries
- repository index: set/query flags, iteration over flagged items (NSIndex)
- repository: sync write file in get_fd
- stats: deduplicated size now, was deduplicated compressed size in borg 1.x
- remove csize support at most places in the code (chunks index, stats, get_size,
  Item.chunks)
- replace problematic/ugly hardlink_master approach of borg 1.x by:

  - symmetric hlid (all hardlinks pointing to same inode have same hlid)
  - all archived hardlinked regular files have a chunks list
- borg rcreate --other-repo=OTHER_REPO: reuse key material from OTHER_REPO, #6554.
  This is useful if you want to use borg transfer to transfer archives from an
  existing borg 1.1/1.2 repo. If the chunker secret and the id key and algorithm
  stay the same, the deduplication will also work between past and future backups.
- borg transfer:

  - efficiently copy archives from a borg 1.1/1.2 repo to a new repo.
    uses deduplication and does not decompress/recompress file content data.
  - does some cleanups / fixes / conversions:

    - disallow None value for .user/group/chunks/chunks_healthy
    - cleanup msgpack related str/bytes mess, use new msgpack spec, #968
    - obfuscation: fix byte order for size, #6701
    - compression: use the 2 bytes for type and level, #6698
    - use version 2 for new archives
    - convert timestamps int/bigint -> msgpack.Timestamp, see #2323
    - all hardlinks have chunks, maybe chunks_healthy, hlid
    - remove the zlib type bytes hack
    - make sure items with chunks have precomputed size
    - removes the csize element from the tuples in the Item.chunks list
    - clean item of attic 0.13 'acl' bug remnants
- crypto: see 1.3.0a1 log entry
- removed "borg upgrade" command (not needed any more)
- compact: removed --cleanup-commits option
- docs: fixed quickstart and usage docs with new cli command syntax
- docs: removed the parts talking about potential AES-CTR mode issues
  (we will not use that any more).


Version 1.3.0a1 (2022-04-15)
----------------------------

Although this was released as 1.3.0a1, it can be also seen as 2.0.0a1 as it was
later decided to do breaking changes and thus the major release number had to
be increased (thus, there will not be a 1.3.0 release, but 2.0.0).

New features:

- init: new --encryption=(repokey|keyfile)-[blake2-](aes-ocb|chacha20-poly1305)

  - New, better, faster crypto (see encryption-aead diagram in the docs), #6463.
  - New AEAD cipher suites: AES-OCB and CHACHA20-POLY1305.
  - Session keys are derived via HKDF from random session id and master key.
  - Nonces/MessageIVs are counters starting from 0 for each session.
  - AAD: chunk id, key type, messageIV, sessionID are now authenticated also.
  - Solves the potential AES-CTR mode counter management issues of the legacy crypto.
- init: --key-algorithm=argon2 (new default KDF, older pbkdf2 also still available)

  borg key change-passphrase / change-location keeps the key algorithm unchanged.
- key change-algorithm: to upgrade existing keys to argon2 or downgrade to pbkdf2.

  We recommend you to upgrade unless you have to keep the key compatible with older versions of borg.
- key change-location: usable for repokey <-> keyfile location change
- benchmark cpu: display benchmarks of cpu bound stuff
- export-tar: new --tar-format=PAX (default: GNU)
- import-tar/export-tar: can use PAX format for ctime and atime support
- import-tar/export-tar: --tar-format=BORG: roundtrip ALL item metadata, #5830
- repository: create and use version 2 repos only for now
- repository: implement PUT2: header crc32, overall xxh64, #1704

Other changes:

- require python >= 3.9, #6315
- simplify libs setup, #6482
- unbundle most bundled 3rd party code, use libs, #6316
- use libdeflate.crc32 (Linux and all others) or zlib.crc32 (macOS)
- repository: code cleanups / simplifications
- internal crypto api: speedups / cleanups / refactorings / modernisation
- remove "borg upgrade" support for "attic backup" repos
- remove PassphraseKey code and borg key migrate-to-repokey command
- OpenBSD: build borg with OpenSSL (not: LibreSSL), #6474
- remove support for LibreSSL, #6474
- remove support for OpenSSL < 1.1.1
