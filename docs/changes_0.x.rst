Change Log 0.x
==============

Version 0.30.0 (2016-01-23)
---------------------------

Compatibility notes:

- The new default logging level is WARNING. Previously, it was INFO, which was
  more verbose. Use -v (or --info) to show once again log level INFO messages.
  See the "general" section in the usage docs.
- For borg create, you need --list (in addition to -v) to see the long file
  list (was needed so you can have e.g. --stats alone without the long list)
- See below about BORG_DELETE_I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING (was:
  BORG_CHECK_I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING)

Bug fixes:

- fix crash when using borg create --dry-run --keep-tag-files, #570
- make sure teardown with cleanup happens for Cache and RepositoryCache,
  avoiding leftover locks and TEMP dir contents, #285 (partially), #548
- fix locking KeyError, partial fix for #502
- log stats consistently, #526
- add abbreviated weekday to timestamp format, fixes #496
- strip whitespace when loading exclusions from file
- unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH before invoking ssh, fixes strange OpenSSL library
  version warning when using the borg binary, #514
- add some error handling/fallback for C library loading, #494
- added BORG_DELETE_I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING for check in "borg delete", #503
- remove unused "repair" rpc method name

New features:

- borg create: implement exclusions using regular expression patterns.
- borg create: implement inclusions using patterns.
- borg extract: support patterns, #361
- support different styles for patterns:

  - fnmatch (`fm:` prefix, default when omitted), like borg <= 0.29.
  - shell (`sh:` prefix) with `*` not matching directory separators and
    `**/` matching 0..n directories
  - path prefix (`pp:` prefix, for unifying borg create pp1 pp2 into the
    patterns system), semantics like in borg <= 0.29
  - regular expression (`re:`), new!
- --progress option for borg upgrade (#291) and borg delete <archive>
- update progress indication more often (e.g. for borg create within big
  files or for borg check repo), #500
- finer chunker granularity for items metadata stream, #547, #487
- borg create --list is now used (in addition to -v) to enable the verbose
  file list output
- display borg version below tracebacks, #532

Other changes:

- hashtable size (and thus: RAM and disk consumption) follows a growth policy:
  grows fast while small, grows slower when getting bigger, #527
- Vagrantfile: use pyinstaller 3.1 to build binaries, freebsd sqlite3 fix,
  fixes #569
- no separate binaries for centos6 any more because the generic linux binaries
  also work on centos6 (or in general: on systems with a slightly older glibc
  than debian7
- dev environment: require virtualenv<14.0 so we get a py32 compatible pip
- docs:

  - add space-saving chunks.archive.d trick to FAQ
  - important: clarify -v and log levels in usage -> general, please read!
  - sphinx configuration: create a simple man page from usage docs
  - add a repo server setup example
  - disable unneeded SSH features in authorized_keys examples for security.
  - borg prune only knows "--keep-within" and not "--within"
  - add gource video to resources docs, #507
  - add netbsd install instructions
  - authors: make it more clear what refers to borg and what to attic
  - document standalone binary requirements, #499
  - rephrase the mailing list section
  - development docs: run build_api and build_usage before tagging release
  - internals docs: hash table max. load factor is 0.75 now
  - markup, typo, grammar, phrasing, clarifications and other fixes.
  - add gcc gcc-c++ to redhat/fedora/corora install docs, fixes #583


Version 0.29.0 (2015-12-13)
---------------------------

Compatibility notes:

- When upgrading to 0.29.0, you need to upgrade client as well as server
  installations due to the locking and command-line interface changes; otherwise
  you'll get an error message about an RPC protocol mismatch or a wrong command-line
  option.
  If you run a server that needs to support both old and new clients, it is
  suggested that you have a "borg-0.28.2" and a "borg-0.29.0" command.
  clients then can choose via e.g. "borg --remote-path=borg-0.29.0 ...".
- The default waiting time for a lock changed from infinity to 1 second for a
  better interactive user experience. If the repo you want to access is
  currently locked, borg will now terminate after 1s with an error message.
  If you have scripts that should wait for the lock for a longer time, use
  --lock-wait N (with N being the maximum wait time in seconds).

Bug fixes:

- hash table tuning (better chosen hashtable load factor 0.75 and prime initial
  size of 1031 gave ~1000x speedup in some scenarios)
- avoid creation of an orphan lock for one case, #285
- --keep-tag-files: fix file mode and multiple tag files in one directory, #432
- fixes for "borg upgrade" (attic repo converter), #466
- remove --progress isatty magic (and also --no-progress option) again, #476
- borg init: display proper repo URL
- fix format of umask in help pages, #463

New features:

- implement --lock-wait, support timeout for UpgradableLock, #210
- implement borg break-lock command, #157
- include system info below traceback, #324
- sane remote logging, remote stderr, #461:

  - remote log output: intercept it and log it via local logging system,
    with "Remote: " prefixed to message. log remote tracebacks.
  - remote stderr: output it to local stderr with "Remote: " prefixed.
- add --debug and --info (same as --verbose) to set the log level of the
  builtin logging configuration (which otherwise defaults to warning), #426
  note: there are few messages emitted at DEBUG level currently.
- optionally configure logging via env var BORG_LOGGING_CONF
- add --filter option for status characters: e.g. to show only the added
  or modified files (and also errors), use "borg create -v --filter=AME ...".
- more progress indicators, #394
- use ISO-8601 date and time format, #375
- "borg check --prefix" to restrict archive checking to that name prefix, #206

Other changes:

- hashindex_add C implementation (speed up cache re-sync for new archives)
- increase FUSE read_size to 1024 (speed up metadata operations)
- check/delete/prune --save-space: free unused segments quickly, #239
- increase rpc protocol version to 2 (see also Compatibility notes), #458
- silence borg by default (via default log level WARNING)
- get rid of C compiler warnings, #391
- upgrade OS X FUSE to 3.0.9 on the OS X binary build system
- use python 3.5.1 to build binaries
- docs:

  - new mailing list borgbackup@python.org, #468
  - readthedocs: color and logo improvements
  - load coverage icons over SSL (avoids mixed content)
  - more precise binary installation steps
  - update release procedure docs about OS X FUSE
  - FAQ entry about unexpected 'A' status for unchanged file(s), #403
  - add docs about 'E' file status
  - add "borg upgrade" docs, #464
  - add developer docs about output and logging
  - clarify encryption, add note about client-side encryption
  - add resources section, with videos, talks, presentations, #149
  - Borg moved to Arch Linux [community]
  - fix wrong installation instructions for archlinux


Version 0.28.2 (2015-11-15)
---------------------------

New features:

- borg create --exclude-if-present TAGFILE - exclude directories that have the
  given file from the backup. You can additionally give --keep-tag-files to
  preserve just the directory roots and the tag-files (but not back up other
  directory contents), #395, attic #128, attic #142

Other changes:

- do not create docs sources at build time (just have them in the repo),
  completely remove have_cython() hack, do not use the "mock" library at build

- docs update about python and binary requirements
- better docs for --read-special, fix #220
- re-built the binaries, fix #218 and #213 (glibc version issue)
- update web site about single-file pyinstaller binaries

Note: if you did a python-based installation, there is no need to upgrade.


Version 0.26.0 (2015-09-19)
---------------------------

New features:

- Faster cache sync (do all in one pass, remove tar/compression stuff), #163
- BORG_REPO env var to specify the default repo, #168
- read special files as if they were regular files, #79
- implement borg create --dry-run, attic issue #267
- Normalize paths before pattern matching on OS X, #143
- support OpenBSD and NetBSD (except xattrs/ACLs)
- support / run tests on Python 3.5

Bug fixes:

- borg mount repo: use absolute path, attic #200, attic #137
- chunker: use off_t to get 64bit on 32bit platform, #178

- fix for obtaining ``char *`` from temporary Python value (old code causes
  a compile error on Mint 17.2)
- llfuse 0.41 install troubles on some platforms, require < 0.41
  (UnicodeDecodeError exception due to non-ascii llfuse setup.py)
- cython code: add some int types to get rid of unspecific python add /

- replace versioneer with setuptools_scm, #106
- docs:

  - pkg-config is needed for llfuse installation
  - be more clear about pruning, attic issue #132

Version 0.25.0 (2015-08-29)
---------------------------

Compatibility notes:

- lz4 compression library (liblz4) is a new requirement (#156)
- the new compression code is very compatible: as long as you stay with zlib
  compression, older borg releases will still be able to read data from a
  repo/archive made with the new code (note: this is not the case for the
  default "none" compression, use "zlib,0" if you want a "no compression" mode
  that can be read by older borg). Also the new code is able to read repos and
  archives made with older borg versions (for all zlib levels  0..9).

Deprecations:

- --compression N (with N being a number, as in 0.24) is deprecated.
  We keep the --compression 0..9 for now not to break scripts, but it is
  deprecated and will be removed later, so better fix your scripts now:
  --compression 0 (as in 0.24) is the same as --compression zlib,0 (now).
  BUT: if you do not want compression, use --compression none
  (which is the default).
  --compression 1 (in 0.24) is the same as --compression zlib,1 (now)
  --compression 9 (in 0.24) is the same as --compression zlib,9 (now)

New features:

- create --compression none (default, means: do not compress, just pass through
  data "as is". this is more efficient than zlib level 0 as used in borg 0.24)
- create --compression lz4 (super-fast, but not very high compression)
- create --compression zlib,N (slower, higher compression, default for N is 6)
- create --compression lzma,N (slowest, highest compression, default N is 6)
- honor the nodump flag (UF_NODUMP) and do not back up such items
- list --short just outputs a simple list of the files/directories in an archive

Bug fixes:

- fixed --chunker-params parameter order confusion / malfunction, fixes #154
- close fds of segments we delete (during compaction)
- close files which fell out the lrucache
- fadvise DONTNEED now is only called for the byte range actually read, not for
  the whole file, fixes #158.
- fix issue with negative "all archives" size, fixes #165
- restore_xattrs: ignore if setxattr fails with EACCES, fixes #162

Other changes:

- remove fakeroot requirement for tests, tests run faster without fakeroot
  (test setup does not fail any more without fakeroot, so you can run with or
  without fakeroot), fixes #151 and #91.
- more tests for archiver
- recover_segment(): don't assume we have an fd for segment
- lrucache refactoring / cleanup, add dispose function, py.test tests
- generalize hashindex code for any key length (less hardcoding)
- lock roster: catch file not found in remove() method and ignore it
- travis CI: use requirements file
- improved docs:

  - replace hack for llfuse with proper solution (install libfuse-dev)
  - update docs about compression
  - update development docs about fakeroot
  - internals: add some words about lock files / locking system
  - support: mention BountySource and for what it can be used
  - theme: use a lighter green
  - add pypi, wheel, dist package based install docs
  - split install docs into system-specific preparations and generic instructions


Version 0.24.0 (2015-08-09)
---------------------------

Incompatible changes (compared to 0.23):

- borg now always issues --umask NNN option when invoking another borg via ssh
  on the repository server. By that, it's making sure it uses the same umask
  for remote repos as for local ones. Because of this, you must upgrade both
  server and client(s) to 0.24.
- the default umask is 077 now (if you do not specify via --umask) which might
  be a different one as you used previously. The default umask avoids that
  you accidentally give access permissions for group and/or others to files
  created by borg (e.g. the repository).

Deprecations:

- "--encryption passphrase" mode is deprecated, see #85 and #97.
  See the new "--encryption repokey" mode for a replacement.

New features:

- borg create --chunker-params ... to configure the chunker, fixes #16
  (attic #302, attic #300, and somehow also #41).
  This can be used to reduce memory usage caused by chunk management overhead,
  so borg does not create a huge chunks index/repo index and eats all your RAM
  if you back up lots of data in huge files (like VM disk images).
  See docs/misc/create_chunker-params.txt for more information.
- borg info now reports chunk counts in the chunk index.
- borg create --compression 0..9 to select zlib compression level, fixes #66
  (attic #295).
- borg init --encryption repokey (to store the encryption key into the repo),
  fixes #85
- improve at-end error logging, always log exceptions and set exit_code=1
- LoggedIO: better error checks / exceptions / exception handling
- implement --remote-path to allow non-default-path borg locations, #125
- implement --umask M and use 077 as default umask for better security, #117
- borg check: give a named single archive to it, fixes #139
- cache sync: show progress indication
- cache sync: reimplement the chunk index merging in C

Bug fixes:

- fix segfault that happened for unreadable files (chunker: n needs to be a
  signed size_t), #116
- fix the repair mode, #144
- repo delete: add destroy to allowed rpc methods, fixes issue #114
- more compatible repository locking code (based on mkdir), maybe fixes #92
  (attic #317, attic #201).
- better Exception msg if no Borg is installed on the remote repo server, #56
- create a RepositoryCache implementation that can cope with >2GiB,
  fixes attic #326.
- fix Traceback when running check --repair, attic #232
- clarify help text, fixes #73.
- add help string for --no-files-cache, fixes #140

Other changes:

- improved docs:

  - added docs/misc directory for misc. writeups that won't be included
    "as is" into the html docs.
  - document environment variables and return codes (attic #324, attic #52)
  - web site: add related projects, fix web site url, IRC #borgbackup
  - Fedora/Fedora-based install instructions added to docs
  - Cygwin-based install instructions added to docs

  - update internals doc about chunker params, memory usage and compression
  - added docs about development
  - add some words about resource usage in general
  - document how to back up a raw disk
  - add note about how to run borg from virtual env
  - add solutions for (ll)fuse installation problems
  - document what borg check does, fixes #138
  - reorganize borgbackup.github.io sidebar, prev/next at top
  - deduplicate and refactor the docs / README.rst

- use borg-tmp as prefix for temporary files / directories
- short prune options without "keep-" are deprecated, do not suggest them
- improved tox configuration
- remove usage of unittest.mock, always use mock from pypi
- use entrypoints instead of scripts, for better use of the wheel format and
  modern installs
- add requirements.d/development.txt and modify tox.ini
- use travis-ci for testing based on Linux and (new) OS X
- use coverage.py, pytest-cov and codecov.io for test coverage support

I forgot to list some stuff already implemented in 0.23.0, here they are:

New features:

- efficient archive list from manifest, meaning a big speedup for slow
  repo connections and "list <repo>", "delete <repo>", "prune" (attic #242,
  attic #167)
- big speedup for chunks cache sync (esp. for slow repo connections), fixes #18
- hashindex: improve error messages

Other changes:

- explicitly specify binary mode to open binary files
- some easy micro optimizations
