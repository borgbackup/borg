Development
===========

This chapter will get you started with |project_name|' development.

|project_name| is written in Python (with a little bit of Cython and C for
the performance critical parts).


Building a development environment
----------------------------------

First, just install borg into a virtual env as described before.

To install some additional packages needed for running the tests, activate your
virtual env and run::

  pip install -r requirements.d/development.txt


Running the tests
-----------------

The tests are in the borg/testsuite package.

To run them, you need to have fakeroot, tox and pytest installed.

To run the test suite use the following command::

  fakeroot -u tox  # run all tests

Some more advanced examples::

  # verify a changed tox.ini (run this after any change to tox.ini):
  fakeroot -u tox --recreate

  fakeroot -u tox -e py32  # run all tests, but only on python 3.2

  fakeroot -u tox borg.testsuite.locking  # only run 1 test module

  fakeroot -u tox borg.testsuite.locking -- -k '"not Timer"'  # exclude some tests

  fakeroot -u tox borg.testsuite -- -v  # verbose py.test

Important notes:

- Without fakeroot -u some tests will fail.
- When using -- to give options to py.test, you MUST also give borg.testsuite[.module].

Building the docs with Sphinx
-----------------------------

The documentation (in reStructuredText format, .rst) is in docs/.

To build the html version of it, you need to have sphinx installed::

  pip3 install sphinx

Now run::

  cd docs/
  make html

Then point a web browser at docs/_build/html/index.html.
