Welcome to Borg
================
|project_name| is a deduplicating and compressing backup program.
Optionally, it also supports authenticated encryption.

The main goal of |project_name| is to provide an efficient and secure way
to backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes |project_name|
suitable for daily backups since only the changes are stored. The authenticated
encryption makes it suitable for backups to not fully trusted targets.

|project_name| is written in Python (with a little bit of Cython and C for
the performance critical parts).


Easy to use
-----------
Initialize a new backup :ref:`repository <repository_def>` and create your
first backup :ref:`archive <archive_def>` in two lines::

    $ borg init /mnt/backup
    $ borg create /mnt/backup::Monday ~/Documents
    $ borg create --stats /mnt/backup::Tuesday ~/Documents
    Archive name: Tuesday
    Archive fingerprint: 387a5e3f9b0e792e91ce87134b0f4bfe17677d9248cb5337f3fbf3a8e157942a
