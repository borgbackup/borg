Installation
============

There are different ways to install Borg:

- :ref:`distribution-package` - easy and fast if a package is
  available from your distribution.
- :ref:`pyinstaller-binary` - easy and fast, we provide a ready-to-use binary file
  that comes bundled with all dependencies.
- :ref:`source-install`, either:

  - :ref:`pip-installation` - installing a source package with pip needs
    more installation steps and requires all dependencies with
    development headers and a compiler.
  - :ref:`git-installation`  - for developers and power users who want to
    have the latest code or use revision control (each release is
    tagged).

.. _distribution-package:

Distribution Package
--------------------

Some distributions might offer a ready-to-use ``borgbackup``
package which can be installed with the package manager.

.. important:: Those packages may not be up to date with the latest
               Borg releases. Before submitting a bug
               report, check the package version and compare that to
               our latest release then review :doc:`changes` to see if
               the bug has been fixed. Report bugs to the package
               maintainer rather than directly to Borg if the
               package is out of date in the distribution.

.. _pyinstaller-binary:

Standalone Binary
-----------------

.. note:: Releases are signed with an OpenPGP key, see
          :ref:`security-contact` for more instructions.

Borg x86/x64 amd/intel compatible binaries (generated with `pyinstaller`_)
are available on the releases_ page for the following platforms:

* **Linux**: glibc >= 2.28 (ok for most supported Linux releases).
  Older glibc releases are untested and may not work.
* **MacOS**: 10.12 or newer (To avoid signing issues download the file via
  command line **or** remove the ``quarantine`` attribute after downloading:
  ``$ xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine borg-macosx64.tgz``)
* **FreeBSD**: 12.1 (unknown whether it works for older releases)

ARM binaries are built by Johann Bauer, see: https://borg.bauerj.eu/

To install such a binary, just drop it into a directory in your ``PATH``,
make borg readable and executable for its users and then you can run ``borg``::

    sudo cp borg-linux64 /usr/local/bin/borg
    sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/borg
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/borg

Optionally you can create a symlink to have ``borgfs`` available, which is an
alias for ``borg mount``::

    ln -s /usr/local/bin/borg /usr/local/bin/borgfs

Note that the binary uses /tmp to unpack Borg with all dependencies. It will
fail if /tmp has not enough free space or is mounted with the ``noexec``
option. You can change the temporary directory by setting the ``TEMP``
environment variable before running Borg.

If a new version is released, you will have to manually download it and replace
the old version using the same steps as shown above.

.. _source-install:

From Source
-----------

.. note::

  Some older Linux systems (like RHEL/CentOS 5) and Python interpreter binaries
  compiled to be able to run on such systems (like Python installed via Anaconda)
  might miss functions required by Borg.

  This issue will be detected early and Borg will abort with a fatal error.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install Borg from a source package (including pip), you have to install the
following dependencies first:

* `Python 3`_ >= 3.8.0, plus development headers.
* OpenSSL_ >= 1.0.0, plus development headers.
* libacl_ (which depends on libattr_), both plus development headers.
* We have bundled code of the following packages, but borg by default (see
  setup.py if you want to change that) prefers a shared library if it can
  be found on the system (lib + dev headers) at build time:

  - liblz4_ >= 1.7.0 (r129)
  - libzstd_ >= 1.3.0
  - libxxhash >= 0.8.1 (0.8.0 might work also)
* pkg-config (cli tool) and pkgconfig python package (borg uses these to
  discover header and library location - if it can't import pkgconfig and
  is not pointed to header/library locations via env vars [see setup.py],
  it will fall back to using the bundled code, see above).
  **These must be present before invoking setup.py!**
* some other Python dependencies, pip will automatically install them for you.
* optionally, if you wish to mount an archive as a FUSE filesystem, you need
  a FUSE implementation for Python:

  - Either pyfuse3_ (preferably, newer and maintained) or llfuse_ (older,
    unmaintained now). See also the BORG_FUSE_IMPL env variable.
  - See setup.py about the version requirements.

If you have troubles finding the right package names, have a look at the
distribution specific sections below or the Vagrantfile in the git repository,
which contains installation scripts for a number of operating systems.

In the following, the steps needed to install the dependencies are listed for a
selection of platforms. If your distribution is not covered by these
instructions, try to use your package manager to install the dependencies.  On
FreeBSD, you may need to get a recent enough OpenSSL version from FreeBSD
ports.

After you have installed the dependencies, you can proceed with steps outlined
under :ref:`pip-installation`.

Debian / Ubuntu
+++++++++++++++

Install the dependencies with development headers::

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-pip python3-virtualenv \
    libacl1-dev libacl1 \
    libssl-dev \
    liblz4-dev libzstd-dev libxxhash-dev \
    build-essential \
    pkg-config python3-pkgconfig
    sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev fuse    # needed for llfuse
    sudo apt-get install libfuse3-dev fuse3  # needed for pyfuse3

In case you get complaints about permission denied on ``/etc/fuse.conf``: on
Ubuntu this means your user is not in the ``fuse`` group. Add yourself to that
group, log out and log in again.

Fedora
++++++

Install the dependencies with development headers::

    sudo dnf install python3 python3-devel python3-pip python3-virtualenv \
    libacl-devel libacl \
    openssl-devel \
    lz4-devel libzstd-devel xxhash-devel \
    pkgconf python3-pkgconfig
    sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ redhat-rpm-config
    sudo dnf install fuse-devel fuse         # needed for llfuse
    sudo dnf install fuse3-devel fuse3       # needed for pyfuse3

openSUSE Tumbleweed / Leap
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Install the dependencies automatically using zypper::

    sudo zypper source-install --build-deps-only borgbackup

Alternatively, you can enumerate all build dependencies in the command line::

    sudo zypper install python3 python3-devel \
    libacl-devel openssl-devel \
    libxxhash-devel \
    python3-Cython python3-Sphinx python3-msgpack-python python3-pkgconfig pkgconf \
    python3-pytest python3-setuptools python3-setuptools_scm \
    python3-sphinx_rtd_theme gcc gcc-c++
    sudo zypper install python3-llfuse  # llfuse

macOS
+++++

When installing via Homebrew_, dependencies are installed automatically. To install
dependencies manually::

    brew install python3 openssl zstd lz4 xxhash
    brew install pkg-config
    pip3 install virtualenv pkgconfig

For FUSE support to mount the backup archives, you need at least version 3.0 of
macFUSE, which is available via `github
<https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases/latest>`__, or Homebrew::

    brew install --cask macfuse

When installing Borg via ``pip``, be sure to install the ``llfuse`` extra,
since macFUSE only supports FUSE API v2. Also, since Homebrew won't link
the installed ``openssl`` formula, point pkg-config to the correct path::

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig" pip install borgbackup[llfuse]

For OS X Catalina and later, be aware that you must authorize full disk access.
It is no longer sufficient to run borg backups as root. If you have not yet
granted full disk access, and you run Borg backup from cron, you will see
messages such as::

    /Users/you/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary: scandir: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted:

To fix this problem, you should grant full disk access to cron, and to your
Terminal application. More information `can be found here
<https://osxdaily.com/2020/04/27/fix-cron-permissions-macos-full-disk-access/>`__.

FreeBSD
++++++++

Listed below are packages you will need to install Borg, its dependencies,
and commands to make FUSE work for using the mount command.

::

     pkg install -y python3 pkgconf
     pkg install openssl
     pkg install liblz4 zstd xxhash
     pkg install fusefs-libs  # needed for llfuse
     pkg install -y git
     python3 -m ensurepip # to install pip for Python3
     To use the mount command:
     echo 'fuse_load="YES"' >> /boot/loader.conf
     echo 'vfs.usermount=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
     kldload fuse
     sysctl vfs.usermount=1


Windows 10's Linux Subsystem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::
    Running under Windows 10's Linux Subsystem is experimental and has not been tested much yet.

Just follow the Ubuntu Linux installation steps. You can omit the FUSE stuff, it won't work anyway.


Cygwin
++++++

.. note::
    Running under Cygwin is experimental and has not been tested much yet.

Use the Cygwin installer to install the dependencies::

    python38 python38-devel python38-pkgconfig
    python38-setuptools python38-pip python38-wheel python38-virtualenv
    libssl-devel libxxhash-devel liblz4-devel libzstd-devel
    binutils gcc-g++ git make openssh


.. _pip-installation:

Using pip
~~~~~~~~~

Virtualenv_ can be used to build and install Borg without affecting
the system Python or requiring root access.  Using a virtual environment is
optional, but recommended except for the most simple use cases.

.. note::
    If you install into a virtual environment, you need to **activate** it
    first (``source borg-env/bin/activate``), before running ``borg``.
    Alternatively, symlink ``borg-env/bin/borg`` into some directory that is in
    your ``PATH`` so you can just run ``borg``.

This will use ``pip`` to install the latest release from PyPi::

    virtualenv --python=python3 borg-env
    source borg-env/bin/activate

    # might be required if your tools are outdated
    pip install -U pip setuptools wheel

    # pkgconfig MUST be available before borg is installed!
    pip install pkgconfig

    # install Borg + Python dependencies into virtualenv
    pip install borgbackup
    # or alternatively (if you want FUSE support):
    pip install borgbackup[llfuse]  # to use llfuse
    pip install borgbackup[pyfuse3]  # to use pyfuse3

To upgrade Borg to a new version later, run the following after
activating your virtual environment::

    pip install -U borgbackup  # or ... borgbackup[llfuse/pyfuse3]

When doing manual pip installation, man pages are not automatically
installed.  You can run these commands to install the man pages
locally::

    # get borg from github
    git clone https://github.com/borgbackup/borg.git borg

    # Install the files with proper permissions
    install -D -m 0644 borg/docs/man/borg*.1* $HOME/.local/share/man/man1/borg.1

    # Update the man page cache
    mandb

.. _git-installation:

Using git
~~~~~~~~~

This uses latest, unreleased development code from git.
While we try not to break master, there are no guarantees on anything.

::

    # get borg from github
    git clone https://github.com/borgbackup/borg.git

    # create a virtual environment
    virtualenv --python=$(which python3) borg-env
    source borg-env/bin/activate   # always before using!

    # install borg + dependencies into virtualenv
    cd borg
    pip install -r requirements.d/development.txt
    pip install -r requirements.d/docs.txt  # optional, to build the docs

    pip install -e .           # in-place editable mode
    or
    pip install -e .[pyfuse3]  # in-place editable mode, use pyfuse3
    or
    pip install -e .[llfuse]   # in-place editable mode, use llfuse

    # optional: run all the tests, on all installed Python versions
    # requires fakeroot, available through your package manager
    fakeroot -u tox --skip-missing-interpreters

By default the system installation of python will be used.
If you need to use a different version of Python you can install this using ``pyenv``:

::

    ...
    # create a virtual environment
    pyenv install 3.8.0  # minimum, preferably use something more recent!
    pyenv global 3.8.0
    pyenv local 3.8.0
    virtualenv --python=${pyenv which python} borg-env
    source borg-env/bin/activate   # always before using!
    ...

.. note:: As a developer or power user, you always want to use a virtual environment.
