Installation
============

There are different ways to install |project_name|:

- **distribution package** - easy and fast if a package is available for your
  Linux/BSD distribution.
- **PyInstaller binary** - easy and fast, we provide a ready-to-use binary file
  that comes bundled with all dependencies.
- **pip** - installing a source package with pip needs more installation steps
  and requires all dependencies with development headers and a compiler.
- **git** - for developers and power users who want to have the latest code or
  use revision control (each release is tagged).


Installation (Distribution Package)
-----------------------------------

Some Linux and BSD distributions might offer a ready-to-use ``borgbackup``
package which can be installed with the package manager.  As |project_name| is
still a young project, such a package might be not available for your system
yet. Please ask package maintainers to build a package or, if you can package /
submit it yourself, please help us with that!

* On **Arch Linux**, there is a package available in the AUR_.

If a package is available, it might be interesting to check its version
and compare that to our latest release and review the :doc:`changes`.

.. _AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/borgbackup/


Installation (PyInstaller Binary)
---------------------------------

The |project_name| binary is available on the releases_ page for the following
platforms:

* **Linux**: glibc >= 2.13 (ok for most supported Linux releases)
* **Mac OS X**: 10.10 (unknown whether it works for older releases)
* **FreeBSD**: 10.2 (unknown whether it works for older releases)

These binaries work without requiring specific installation steps. Just drop
them into a directory in your ``PATH`` and then you can run ``borg``. If a new
version is released, you will have to manually download it and replace the old
version.

Installing the Dependencies
---------------------------

To install |project_name| from a source package, you have to install the
following dependencies first:

* `Python 3`_ >= 3.2.2. Even though Python 3 is not the default Python version on
  most systems, it is usually available as an optional install.
* OpenSSL_ >= 1.0.0
* libacl_ (that pulls in libattr_ also)
* liblz4_
* some Python dependencies, pip will automatically install them for you
* optionally, the llfuse_ Python package is required if you wish to mount an
  archive as a FUSE filesystem. FUSE >= 2.8.0 is required for llfuse.

In the following, the steps needed to install the dependencies are listed for a
selection of platforms. If your distribution is not covered by these
instructions, try to use your package manager to install the dependencies.  On
FreeBSD, you may need to get a recent enough OpenSSL version from FreeBSD
ports.

After you have installed the dependencies, you can proceed with steps outlined
under :ref:`pip-installation`.

Debian / Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the dependencies with development headers::

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-pip python-virtualenv
    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev openssl
    sudo apt-get install libacl1-dev libacl1
    sudo apt-get install liblz4-dev liblz4-1
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install libfuse-dev fuse pkg-config    # optional, for FUSE support

In case you get complaints about permission denied on ``/etc/fuse.conf``: on
Ubuntu this means your user is not in the ``fuse`` group. Add yourself to that
group, log out and log in again.

Fedora / Korora
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the dependencies with development headers::

    sudo dnf install python3 python3-devel python3-pip python3-virtualenv
    sudo dnf install openssl-devel openssl
    sudo dnf install libacl-devel libacl
    sudo dnf install lz4-devel
    sudo dnf install fuse-devel fuse pkgconfig         # optional, for FUSE support


Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

Assuming you have installed homebrew_, the following steps will install all the
dependencies::

    brew install python3 lz4 openssl
    pip3 install virtualenv

For FUSE support to mount the backup archives, you need at least version 3.0 of
FUSE for OS X, which is available as a pre-release_.

.. _pre-release: https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/releases

Cygwin
~~~~~~

.. note::
    Running under Cygwin is experimental and has only been tested with Cygwin
    (x86-64) v2.1.0.

Use the Cygwin installer to install the dependencies::

    python3 python3-setuptools
    python3-cython  # not needed for releases
    binutils gcc-core
    libopenssl openssl-devel
    liblz4_1 liblz4-devel  # from cygwinports.org
    git make openssh

You can then install ``pip`` and ``virtualenv``::

    easy_install-3.4 pip
    pip install virtualenv

In case the creation of the virtual environment fails, try deleting this file::

    /usr/lib/python3.4/__pycache__/platform.cpython-34.pyc


.. _pip-installation:

Installation (pip)
------------------

Virtualenv_ can be used to build and install |project_name| without affecting
the system Python or requiring root access.  Using a virtual environment is
optional, but recommended except for the most simple use cases.

.. note::
    If you install into a virtual environment, you need to **activate** it
    first (``source borg-env/bin/activate``), before running ``borg``.
    Alternatively, symlink ``borg-env/bin/borg`` into some directory that is in
    your ``PATH`` so you can just run ``borg``.

This will use ``pip`` to install the latest release from PyPi::

    virtualenv --python=python3 borg-env
    source borg-env/bin/activate

    # install Borg + Python dependencies into virtualenv
    pip install 'llfuse<0.41'  # optional, for FUSE support
                               # 0.41 and 0.41.1 have unicode issues at install time
    pip install borgbackup

To upgrade |project_name| to a new version later, run the following after
activating your virtual environment::

    pip install -U borgbackup


Installation (git)
------------------

This uses latest, unreleased development code from git.
While we try not to break master, there are no guarantees on anything. ::

    # get borg from github
    git clone https://github.com/borgbackup/borg.git

    virtualenv --python=python3 borg-env
    source borg-env/bin/activate   # always before using!

    # install borg + dependencies into virtualenv
    pip install sphinx  # optional, to build the docs
    pip install 'llfuse<0.41'  # optional, for FUSE support
                               # 0.41 and 0.41.1 have unicode issues at install time
    cd borg
    pip install -r requirements.d/development.txt
    pip install -e .  # in-place editable mode

    # optional: run all the tests, on all supported Python versions
    # requires fakeroot, available through your package manager
    fakeroot -u tox

.. note:: As a developer or power user, you always want to use a virtual environment.
