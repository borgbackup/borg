.SH NAME
borg-analyze \- Analyzes archives.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] analyze [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Analyze archives to find \(dqhot spots\(dq.
.sp
\fBborg analyze\fP relies on the usual archive matching options to select the
archives that should be considered for analysis (e.g. \fB\-a series_name\fP).
Then it iterates over all matching archives, over all contained files, and
collects information about chunks stored in all directories it encounters.
.sp
It considers chunk IDs and their plaintext sizes (we do not have the compressed
size in the repository easily available) and adds up the sizes of added and removed
chunks per direct parent directory, and outputs a list of \(dqdirectory: size\(dq.
.sp
You can use that list to find directories with a lot of \(dqactivity\(dq — maybe
some of these are temporary or cache directories you forgot to exclude.
.sp
To avoid including these unwanted directories in your backups, you can carefully
exclude them in \fBborg create\fP (for future backups) or use \fBborg recreate\fP
to recreate existing archives without them.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
See \fIborg\-common(1)\fP for common options of Borg commands.
