.SH NAME
borg-create \- Create new archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] create [options] NAME [PATH...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This command creates a backup archive containing all files found while recursively
traversing all paths specified. Paths are added to the archive as they are given,
that means if relative paths are desired, the command has to be run from the correct
directory.
.sp
The slashdot hack in paths (recursion roots) is triggered by using \fB/./\fP:
\fB/this/gets/stripped/./this/gets/archived\fP means to process that fs object, but
strip the prefix on the left side of \fB\&./\fP from the archived items (in this case,
\fBthis/gets/archived\fP will be the path in the archived item).
.sp
When giving \(aq\-\(aq as path, borg will read data from standard input and create a
file \(aqstdin\(aq in the created archive from that data. In some cases it\(aqs more
appropriate to use \-\-content\-from\-command, however. See section \fIReading from
stdin\fP below for details.
.sp
The archive will consume almost no disk space for files or parts of files that
have already been stored in other archives.
.sp
The archive name does NOT need to be unique, you can and should use the same
name for a series of archives. The unique archive identifier is its ID (hash)
and you can abbreviate the ID as long as it is unique.
.sp
In the archive name, you may use the following placeholders:
{now}, {utcnow}, {fqdn}, {hostname}, {user} and some others.
.sp
Backup speed is increased by not reprocessing files that are already part of
existing archives and weren\(aqt modified. The detection of unmodified files is
done by comparing multiple file metadata values with previous values kept in
the files cache.
.sp
This comparison can operate in different modes as given by \fB\-\-files\-cache\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
ctime,size,inode (default)
.IP \(bu 2
mtime,size,inode (default behaviour of borg versions older than 1.1.0rc4)
.IP \(bu 2
ctime,size (ignore the inode number)
.IP \(bu 2
mtime,size (ignore the inode number)
.IP \(bu 2
rechunk,ctime (all files are considered modified \- rechunk, cache ctime)
.IP \(bu 2
rechunk,mtime (all files are considered modified \- rechunk, cache mtime)
.IP \(bu 2
disabled (disable the files cache, all files considered modified \- rechunk)
.UNINDENT
.sp
inode number: better safety, but often unstable on network filesystems
.sp
Normally, detecting file modifications will take inode information into
consideration to improve the reliability of file change detection.
This is problematic for files located on sshfs and similar network file
systems which do not provide stable inode numbers, such files will always
be considered modified. You can use modes without \fIinode\fP in this case to
improve performance, but reliability of change detection might be reduced.
.sp
ctime vs. mtime: safety vs. speed
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
ctime is a rather safe way to detect changes to a file (metadata and contents)
as it can not be set from userspace. But, a metadata\-only change will already
update the ctime, so there might be some unnecessary chunking/hashing even
without content changes. Some filesystems do not support ctime (change time).
E.g. doing a chown or chmod to a file will change its ctime.
.IP \(bu 2
mtime usually works and only updates if file contents were changed. But mtime
can be arbitrarily set from userspace, e.g. to set mtime back to the same value
it had before a content change happened. This can be used maliciously as well as
well\-meant, but in both cases mtime based cache modes can be problematic.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The mount points of filesystems or filesystem snapshots should be the same for every
creation of a new archive to ensure fast operation. This is because the file cache that
is used to determine changed files quickly uses absolute filenames.
If this is not possible, consider creating a bind mount to a stable location.
.sp
The \fB\-\-progress\fP option shows (from left to right) Original and (uncompressed)
deduplicated size (O and U respectively), then the Number of files (N) processed so far,
followed by the currently processed path.
.sp
When using \fB\-\-stats\fP, you will get some statistics about how much data was
added \- the \(dqThis Archive\(dq deduplicated size there is most interesting as that is
how much your repository will grow. Please note that the \(dqAll archives\(dq stats refer to
the state after creation. Also, the \fB\-\-stats\fP and \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP options are mutually
exclusive because the data is not actually compressed and deduplicated during a dry run.
.sp

.SH NOTES
.sp
The \fB\-\-exclude\fP patterns are not like tar. In tar \fB\-\-exclude\fP .bundler/gems will
exclude foo/.bundler/gems. In borg it will not, you need to use \fB\-\-exclude\fP
\(aq*/.bundler/gems\(aq to get the same effect.
.sp
In addition to using \fB\-\-exclude\fP patterns, it is possible to use
\fB\-\-exclude\-if\-present\fP to specify the name of a filesystem object (e.g. a file
or folder name) which, when contained within another folder, will prevent the
containing folder from being backed up.  By default, the containing folder and
all of its contents will be omitted from the backup.  If, however, you wish to
only include the objects specified by \fB\-\-exclude\-if\-present\fP in your backup,
and not include any other contents of the containing folder, this can be enabled
through using the \fB\-\-keep\-exclude\-tags\fP option.
.sp
The \fB\-x\fP or \fB\-\-one\-file\-system\fP option excludes directories, that are mountpoints (and everything in them).
It detects mountpoints by comparing the device number from the output of \fBstat()\fP of the directory and its
parent directory. Specifically, it excludes directories for which \fBstat()\fP reports a device number different
from the device number of their parent.
In general: be aware that there are directories with device number different from their parent, which the kernel
does not consider a mountpoint and also the other way around.
Linux examples for this are bind mounts (possibly same device number, but always a mountpoint) and ALL
subvolumes of a btrfs (different device number from parent but not necessarily a mountpoint).
macOS examples are the apfs mounts of a typical macOS installation.
Therefore, when using \fB\-\-one\-file\-system\fP, you should double\-check that the backup works as intended.
.SS Item flags
.sp
\fB\-\-list\fP outputs a list of all files, directories and other
file system items it considered (no matter whether they had content changes
or not). For each item, it prefixes a single\-letter flag that indicates type
and/or status of the item.
.sp
If you are interested only in a subset of that output, you can give e.g.
\fB\-\-filter=AME\fP and it will only show regular files with A, M or E status (see
below).
.sp
A uppercase character represents the status of a regular file relative to the
\(dqfiles\(dq cache (not relative to the repo \-\- this is an issue if the files cache
is not used). Metadata is stored in any case and for \(aqA\(aq and \(aqM\(aq also new data
chunks are stored. For \(aqU\(aq all data chunks refer to already existing chunks.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqA\(aq = regular file, added (see also \fIa_status_oddity\fP in the FAQ)
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqM\(aq = regular file, modified
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqU\(aq = regular file, unchanged
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqC\(aq = regular file, it changed while we backed it up
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqE\(aq = regular file, an error happened while accessing/reading \fIthis\fP file
.UNINDENT
.sp
A lowercase character means a file type other than a regular file,
borg usually just stores their metadata:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqd\(aq = directory
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqb\(aq = block device
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqc\(aq = char device
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqh\(aq = regular file, hardlink (to already seen inodes)
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqs\(aq = symlink
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqf\(aq = fifo
.UNINDENT
.sp
Other flags used include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\(aq+\(aq = included, item would be backed up (if not in dry\-run mode)
.IP \(bu 2
\(aq\-\(aq = excluded, item would not be / was not backed up
.IP \(bu 2
\(aqi\(aq = backup data was read from standard input (stdin)
.IP \(bu 2
\(aq?\(aq = missing status code (if you see this, please file a bug report!)
.UNINDENT
.SS Reading backup data from stdin
.sp
There are two methods to read from stdin. Either specify \fB\-\fP as path and
pipe directly to borg:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
backup\-vm \-\-id myvm \-\-stdout | borg create \-\-repo REPO ARCHIVE \-
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or use \fB\-\-content\-from\-command\fP to have Borg manage the execution of the
command and piping. If you do so, the first PATH argument is interpreted
as command to execute and any further arguments are treated as arguments
to the command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
borg create \-\-content\-from\-command \-\-repo REPO ARCHIVE \-\- backup\-vm \-\-id myvm \-\-stdout
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fB\-\-\fP is used to ensure \fB\-\-id\fP and \fB\-\-stdout\fP are \fBnot\fP considered
arguments to \fBborg\fP but rather \fBbackup\-vm\fP\&.
.sp
The difference between the two approaches is that piping to borg creates an
archive even if the command piping to borg exits with a failure. In this case,
\fBone can end up with truncated output being backed up\fP\&. Using
\fB\-\-content\-from\-command\fP, in contrast, borg is guaranteed to fail without
creating an archive should the command fail. The command is considered failed
when it returned a non\-zero exit code.
.sp
Reading from stdin yields just a stream of data without file metadata
associated with it, and the files cache is not needed at all. So it is
safe to disable it via \fB\-\-files\-cache disabled\fP and speed up backup
creation a bit.
.sp
By default, the content read from stdin is stored in a file called \(aqstdin\(aq.
Use \fB\-\-stdin\-name\fP to change the name.
.SS Feeding all file paths from externally
.sp
Usually, you give a starting path (recursion root) to borg and then borg
automatically recurses, finds and backs up all fs objects contained in
there (optionally considering include/exclude rules).
.sp
If you need more control and you want to give every single fs object path
to borg (maybe implementing your own recursion or your own rules), you can use
\fB\-\-paths\-from\-stdin\fP or \fB\-\-paths\-from\-command\fP (with the latter, borg will
fail to create an archive should the command fail).
.sp
Borg supports paths with the slashdot hack to strip path prefixes here also.
So, be careful not to unintentionally trigger that.
