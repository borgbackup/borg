.SH NAME
borg-delete \- Delete an existing repository or archives
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] delete [options] [REPOSITORY_OR_ARCHIVE] [ARCHIVE...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This command deletes an archive from the repository or the complete repository.
.sp
Important: When deleting archives, repository disk space is \fBnot\fP freed until
you run \fBborg compact\fP\&.
.sp
When you delete a complete repository, the security info and local cache for it
(if any) are also deleted. Alternatively, you can delete just the local cache
with the \fB\-\-cache\-only\fP option, or keep the security info with the
\fB\-\-keep\-security\-info\fP option.
.sp
When in doubt, use \fB\-\-dry\-run \-\-list\fP to see what would be deleted.
.sp
When using \fB\-\-stats\fP, you will get some statistics about how much data was
deleted \- the \(dqDeleted data\(dq deduplicated size there is most interesting as
that is how much your repository will shrink.
Please note that the \(dqAll archives\(dq stats refer to the state after deletion.
.sp
You can delete multiple archives by specifying a shell pattern to match
multiple archives using the \fB\-\-glob\-archives GLOB\fP option (for more info on
these patterns, see \fIborg_patterns\fP).
.sp
To avoid accidentally deleting archives, especially when using glob patterns,
it might be helpful to use the \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP to test out the command without
actually making any changes to the repository.
