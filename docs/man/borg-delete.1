.SH NAME
borg-delete \- Delete archives
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] delete [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This command deletes archives from the repository.
.sp
Important: When deleting archives, repository disk space is \fBnot\fP freed until
you run \fBborg compact\fP\&.
.sp
When in doubt, use \fB\-\-dry\-run \-\-list\fP to see what would be deleted.
.sp
When using \fB\-\-stats\fP, you will get some statistics about how much data was
deleted \- the \(dqDeleted data\(dq deduplicated size there is most interesting as
that is how much your repository will shrink.
Please note that the \(dqAll archives\(dq stats refer to the state after deletion.
.sp
You can delete multiple archives by specifying a matching pattern,
using the \fB\-\-match\-archives PATTERN\fP option (for more info on these patterns,
see \fIborg_patterns\fP).
.sp
Always first use \fB\-\-dry\-run \-\-list\fP to see what would be deleted.
