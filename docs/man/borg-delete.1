.TH "BORG-DELETE" 1 "2022-08-07" "" "borg backup tool"
.SH NAME
borg-delete \- Delete archives
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] delete [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This command deletes archives from the repository.
.sp
Important: When deleting archives, repository disk space is \fBnot\fP freed until
you run \fBborg compact\fP\&.
.sp
When in doubt, use \fB\-\-dry\-run \-\-list\fP to see what would be deleted.
.sp
When using \fB\-\-stats\fP, you will get some statistics about how much data was
deleted \- the "Deleted data" deduplicated size there is most interesting as
that is how much your repository will shrink.
Please note that the "All archives" stats refer to the state after deletion.
.sp
You can delete multiple archives by specifying a matching shell pattern,
using the \fB\-\-glob\-archives GLOB\fP option (for more info on these patterns,
see \fIborg_patterns\fP).
.sp
Always first use \fB\-\-dry\-run \-\-list\fP to see what would be deleted.
