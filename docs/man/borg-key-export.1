.TH "BORG-KEY-EXPORT" 1 "2022-10-02" "" "borg backup tool"
.SH NAME
borg-key-export \- Export the repository key for backup
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] key export [options] [PATH]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
If repository encryption is used, the repository is inaccessible
without the key. This command allows one to backup this essential key.
Note that the backup produced does not include the passphrase itself
(i.e. the exported key stays encrypted). In order to regain access to a
repository, one needs both the exported key and the original passphrase.
.sp
There are three backup formats. The normal backup format is suitable for
digital storage as a file. The \fB\-\-paper\fP backup format is optimized
for printing and typing in while importing, with per line checks to
reduce problems with manual input. The \fB\-\-qr\-html\fP creates a printable
HTML template with a QR code and a copy of the \fB\-\-paper\fP\-formatted key.
.sp
For repositories using keyfile encryption the key is saved locally
on the system that is capable of doing backups. To guard against loss
of this key, the key needs to be backed up independently of the main
data backup.
.sp
For repositories using the repokey encryption the key is saved in the
repository in the config file. A backup is thus not strictly needed,
but guards against the repository becoming inaccessible if the file
is damaged for some reason.
