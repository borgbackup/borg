.TH "BORG-MOUNT" 1 "2022-08-07" "" "borg backup tool"
.SH NAME
borg-mount \- Mount archive or an entire repository as a FUSE filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] mount [options] MOUNTPOINT [PATH...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This command mounts an archive as a FUSE filesystem. This can be useful
for browsing an archive or restoring individual files. When restoring,
take into account that the current FUSE implementation does not support
special fs flags and ACLs.
.sp
Unless the \fB\-\-foreground\fP option is given the command will run in the
background until the filesystem is \fBumounted\fP\&.
.sp
The command \fBborgfs\fP provides a wrapper for \fBborg mount\fP\&. This can also be
used in fstab entries:
\fB/path/to/repo /mnt/point fuse.borgfs defaults,noauto 0 0\fP
.sp
To allow a regular user to use fstab entries, add the \fBuser\fP option:
\fB/path/to/repo /mnt/point fuse.borgfs defaults,noauto,user 0 0\fP
.sp
For FUSE configuration and mount options, see the mount.fuse(8) manual page.
.sp
Borg\(aqs default behavior is to use the archived user and group names of each
file and map them to the system\(aqs respective user and group ids.
Alternatively, using \fBnumeric\-ids\fP will instead use the archived user and
group ids without any mapping.
.sp
The \fBuid\fP and \fBgid\fP mount options (implemented by Borg) can be used to
override the user and group ids of all files (i.e., \fBborg mount \-o
uid=1000,gid=1000\fP).
.sp
The man page references \fBuser_id\fP and \fBgroup_id\fP mount options
(implemented by fuse) which specify the user and group id of the mount owner
(aka, the user who does the mounting). It is set automatically by libfuse (or
the filesystem if libfuse is not used). However, you should not specify these
manually. Unlike the \fBuid\fP and \fBgid\fP mount options which affect all files,
\fBuser_id\fP and \fBgroup_id\fP affect the user and group id of the mounted
(base) directory.
.sp
Additional mount options supported by borg:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
versions: when used with a repository mount, this gives a merged, versioned
view of the files in the archives. EXPERIMENTAL, layout may change in future.
.IP \(bu 2
allow_damaged_files: by default damaged files (where missing chunks were
replaced with runs of zeros by borg check \fB\-\-repair\fP) are not readable and
return EIO (I/O error). Set this option to read such files.
.IP \(bu 2
ignore_permissions: for security reasons the "default_permissions" mount
option is internally enforced by borg. "ignore_permissions" can be given to
not enforce "default_permissions".
.UNINDENT
.sp
The BORG_MOUNT_DATA_CACHE_ENTRIES environment variable is meant for advanced users
to tweak the performance. It sets the number of cached data chunks; additional
memory usage can be up to ~8 MiB times this number. The default is the number
of CPU cores.
.sp
When the daemonized process receives a signal or crashes, it does not unmount.
Unmounting in these cases could cause an active rsync or similar process
to unintentionally delete data.
.sp
When running in the foreground ^C/SIGINT unmounts cleanly, but other
signals or crashes do not.
