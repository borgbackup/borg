.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg prune <options> REPOSITORY
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The prune command prunes a repository by deleting all archives not matching
any of the specified retention options. This command is normally used by
automated backup scripts wanting to keep a certain number of historic backups.
.sp
Also, prune automatically removes checkpoint archives (incomplete archives left
behind by interrupted backup runs) except if the checkpoint is the latest
archive (and thus still needed). Checkpoint archives are not considered when
comparing archive counts against the retention limits (\-\-keep\-X).
.sp
If a prefix is set with \-P, then only archives that start with the prefix are
considered for deletion and only those archives count towards the totals
specified by the rules.
Otherwise, \fIall\fP archives in the repository are candidates for deletion!
There is no automatic distinction between archives representing different
contents. These need to be distinguished by specifying matching prefixes.
.sp
If you have multiple sequences of archives with different data sets (e.g.
from different machines) in one shared repository, use one prune call per
data set that matches only the respective archives using the \-P option.
.sp
The "\-\-keep\-within" option takes an argument of the form "<int><char>",
where char is "H", "d", "w", "m", "y". For example, "\-\-keep\-within 2d" means
to keep all archives that were created within the past 48 hours.
"1m" is taken to mean "31d". The archives kept with this option do not
count towards the totals specified by any other options.
.sp
A good procedure is to thin out more and more the older your backups get.
As an example, "\-\-keep\-daily 7" means to keep the latest backup on each day,
up to 7 most recent days with backups (days without backups do not count).
The rules are applied from secondly to yearly, and backups selected by previous
rules do not count towards those of later rules. The time that each backup
starts is used for pruning purposes. Dates and times are interpreted in
the local timezone, and weeks go from Monday to Sunday. Specifying a
negative number of archives to keep means that there is no limit.
.sp
The "\-\-keep\-last N" option is doing the same as "\-\-keep\-secondly N" (and it will
keep the last N archives under the assumption that you do not create more than one
backup archive in the same second).

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
Be careful, prune is a potentially dangerous command, it will remove backup
archives.
.sp
The default of prune is to apply to \fBall archives in the repository\fP unless
you restrict its operation to a subset of the archives using \fB\-\-prefix\fP\&.
When using \fB\-\-prefix\fP, be careful to choose a good prefix \- e.g. do not use a
prefix "foo" if you do not also want to match "foobar".
.sp
It is strongly recommended to always run \fBprune \-v \-\-list \-\-dry\-run ...\fP
first so you will see what it would do without it actually doing anything.
.sp
There is also a visualized prune example in \fBdocs/misc/prune\-example.txt\fP\&.
