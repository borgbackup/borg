.TH "BORG-RECREATE" "1" "2025-08-02" "" "borg backup tool"
.SH NAME
borg-recreate \- Re-create archives
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] recreate [options] [PATH...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Recreate the contents of existing archives.
.sp
recreate is a potentially dangerous function and might lead to data loss
(if used wrongly). BE VERY CAREFUL!
.sp
Important: Repository disk space is \fBnot\fP freed until you run \fBborg compact\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-exclude\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-from\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-if\-present\fP, \fB\-\-keep\-exclude\-tags\fP
and PATH have the exact same semantics as in \(dqborg create\(dq, but they only check
for files in the archives and not in the local file system. If PATHs are specified,
the resulting archives will only contain files from these PATHs.
.sp
Note that all paths in an archive are relative, therefore absolute patterns/paths
will \fInot\fP match (\fB\-\-exclude\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-from\fP, PATHs).
.sp
\fB\-\-chunker\-params\fP will re\-chunk all files in the archive, this can be
used to have upgraded Borg 0.xx archives deduplicate with Borg 1.x archives.
.sp
\fBUSE WITH CAUTION.\fP
Depending on the PATHs and patterns given, recreate can be used to
delete files from archives permanently.
When in doubt, use \fB\-\-dry\-run \-\-verbose \-\-list\fP to see how patterns/PATHS are
interpreted. See \fIlist_item_flags\fP in \fBborg create\fP for details.
.sp
The archive being recreated is only removed after the operation completes. The
archive that is built during the operation exists at the same time at
\(dq<ARCHIVE>.recreate\(dq. The new archive will have a different archive ID.
.sp
With \fB\-\-target\fP the original archive is not replaced, instead a new archive is created.
.sp
When rechunking, space usage can be substantial \- expect
at least the entire deduplicated size of the archives using the previous
chunker params.
.sp
If your most recent borg check found missing chunks, please first run another
backup for the same data, before doing any rechunking. If you are lucky, that
will re\-create the missing chunks. Optionally, do another borg check, to see
if the chunks are still missing).

.EX
# Create a backup with little but fast compression
$ borg create archive /some/files \-\-compression lz4
# Then compress it \- this might take longer, but the backup has already completed,
# so no inconsistencies from a long\-running backup job.
$ borg recreate \-a archive \-\-recompress \-\-compression zlib,9

# Remove unwanted files from all archives in a repository.
# Note the relative path for the \-\-exclude option \- archives only contain relative paths.
$ borg recreate \-\-exclude home/icke/Pictures/drunk_photos

# Change archive comment
$ borg create \-\-comment \(dqThis is a comment\(dq archivename ~
