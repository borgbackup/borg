.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] recreate <options> REPOSITORY_OR_ARCHIVE PATH
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Recreate the contents of existing archives.
.sp
This is an \fIexperimental\fP feature. Do \fInot\fP use this on your only backup.
.sp
\fB\-\-exclude\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-from\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-if\-present\fP, \fB\-\-keep\-exclude\-tags\fP, and PATH
have the exact same semantics as in "borg create". If PATHs are specified the
resulting archive will only contain files from these PATHs.
.sp
Note that all paths in an archive are relative, therefore absolute patterns/paths
will \fInot\fP match (\fB\-\-exclude\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-from\fP, PATHs).
.sp
\fB\-\-recompress\fP allows to change the compression of existing data in archives.
Due to how Borg stores compressed size information this might display
incorrect information for archives that were not recreated at the same time.
There is no risk of data loss by this.
.sp
\fB\-\-chunker\-params\fP will re\-chunk all files in the archive, this can be
used to have upgraded Borg 0.xx or Attic archives deduplicate with
Borg 1.x archives.
.sp
\fBUSE WITH CAUTION.\fP
Depending on the PATHs and patterns given, recreate can be used to permanently
delete files from archives.
When in doubt, use \fB\-\-dry\-run \-\-verbose \-\-list\fP to see how patterns/PATHS are
interpreted.
.sp
The archive being recreated is only removed after the operation completes. The
archive that is built during the operation exists at the same time at
"<ARCHIVE>.recreate". The new archive will have a different archive ID.
.sp
With \fB\-\-target\fP the original archive is not replaced, instead a new archive is created.
.sp
When rechunking space usage can be substantial, expect at least the entire
deduplicated size of the archives using the previous chunker params.
When recompressing expect approx. (throughput / checkpoint\-interval) in space usage,
assuming all chunks are recompressed.
.SH OPTIONS

.UNINDENT
.SS Exclusion options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-e \ PATTERN\fP,\fB \ \-\-exclude \ PATTERN
exclude paths matching PATTERN
.TP
.BI \-\-exclude\-from \ EXCLUDEFILE
read exclude patterns from EXCLUDEFILE, one per line
.TP
.B \-\-exclude\-caches
exclude directories that contain a CACHEDIR.TAG file (\fI\%http://www.brynosaurus.com/cachedir/spec.html\fP)
.TP
.BI \-\-exclude\-if\-present \ NAME
exclude directories that are tagged by containing a filesystem object with the given NAME
.TP
.B \-\-keep\-exclude\-tags\fP,\fB  \-\-keep\-tag\-files
if tag objects are specified with \fB\-\-exclude\-if\-present\fP, don\(aqt omit the tag objects themselves from the backup archive
.TP
.BI \-\-pattern \ PATTERN
experimental: include/exclude paths matching PATTERN
.TP
.BI \-\-patterns\-from \ PATTERNFILE
experimental: read include/exclude patterns from PATTERNFILE, one per line
.UNINDENT
.SS Archive options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-target \ TARGET
create a new archive with the name ARCHIVE, do not replace existing archive (only applies for a single archive)
.TP
.BI \-c \ SECONDS\fP,\fB \ \-\-checkpoint\-interval \ SECONDS
write checkpoint every SECONDS seconds (Default: 1800)
.TP
.BI \-\-comment \ COMMENT
add a comment text to the archive
.TP
.BI \-\-timestamp \ TIMESTAMP
manually specify the archive creation date/time (UTC, yyyy\-mm\-ddThh:mm:ss format). alternatively, give a reference file/directory.
.TP
.BI \-C \ COMPRESSION\fP,\fB \ \-\-compression \ COMPRESSION
select compression algorithm, see the output of the "borg help compression" command for details.
.TP
.B \-\-recompress
recompress data chunks according to \fB\-\-compression\fP if \fIif\-different\fP\&. When \fIalways\fP, chunks that are already compressed that way are not skipped, but compressed again. Only the algorithm is considered for \fIif\-different\fP, not the compression level (if any).
.TP
.BI \-\-chunker\-params \ PARAMS
specify the chunker parameters (CHUNK_MIN_EXP, CHUNK_MAX_EXP, HASH_MASK_BITS, HASH_WINDOW_SIZE) or \fIdefault\fP to use the current defaults. default: 19,23,21,4095
