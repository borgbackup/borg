.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] recreate [options] [REPOSITORY_OR_ARCHIVE] [PATH...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Recreate the contents of existing archives.
.sp
This is an \fIexperimental\fP feature. Do \fInot\fP use this on your only backup.
.sp
\fB\-\-exclude\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-from\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-if\-present\fP, \fB\-\-keep\-exclude\-tags\fP, and PATH
have the exact same semantics as in "borg create". If PATHs are specified the
resulting archive will only contain files from these PATHs.
.sp
Note that all paths in an archive are relative, therefore absolute patterns/paths
will \fInot\fP match (\fB\-\-exclude\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-from\fP, PATHs).
.sp
\fB\-\-recompress\fP allows to change the compression of existing data in archives.
Due to how Borg stores compressed size information this might display
incorrect information for archives that were not recreated at the same time.
There is no risk of data loss by this.
.sp
\fB\-\-chunker\-params\fP will re\-chunk all files in the archive, this can be
used to have upgraded Borg 0.xx or Attic archives deduplicate with
Borg 1.x archives.
.sp
\fBUSE WITH CAUTION.\fP
Depending on the PATHs and patterns given, recreate can be used to permanently
delete files from archives.
When in doubt, use \fB\-\-dry\-run \-\-verbose \-\-list\fP to see how patterns/PATHS are
interpreted.
.sp
The archive being recreated is only removed after the operation completes. The
archive that is built during the operation exists at the same time at
"<ARCHIVE>.recreate". The new archive will have a different archive ID.
.sp
With \fB\-\-target\fP the original archive is not replaced, instead a new archive is created.
.sp
When rechunking space usage can be substantial, expect at least the entire
deduplicated size of the archives using the previous chunker params.
When recompressing expect approx. (throughput / checkpoint\-interval) in space usage,
assuming all chunks are recompressed.
.sp
If you recently ran borg check \-\-repair and it had to fix lost chunks with all\-zero
replacement chunks, please first run another backup for the same data and re\-run
borg check \-\-repair afterwards to heal any archives that had lost chunks which are
still generated from the input data.
.sp
Important: running borg recreate to re\-chunk will remove the chunks_healthy
metadata of all items with replacement chunks, so healing will not be possible
any more after re\-chunking (it is also unlikely it would ever work: due to the
change of chunking parameters, the missing chunk likely will never be seen again
even if you still have the data that produced it).

.SS Archive options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-target \ TARGET
create a new archive with the name ARCHIVE, do not replace existing archive (only applies for a single archive)

.TP
.BI \-\-comment \ COMMENT
add a comment text to the archive
.TP
.BI \-\-timestamp \ TIMESTAMP
manually specify the archive creation date/time (UTC, yyyy\-mm\-ddThh:mm:ss format). alternatively, give a reference file/directory.

.TP
.BI \-\-recompress \ MODE
recompress data chunks according to \fB\-\-compression\fP\&. MODE \fIif\-different\fP: recompress if current compression is with a different compression algorithm (the level is not considered). MODE \fIalways\fP: recompress even if current compression is with the same compression algorithm (use this to change the compression level). MODE \fInever\fP (default): do not recompress.
.TP
.BI \-\-chunker\-params \ PARAMS
specify the chunker parameters (CHUNK_MIN_EXP, CHUNK_MAX_EXP, HASH_MASK_BITS, HASH_WINDOW_SIZE) or \fIdefault\fP to use the current defaults. default: 19,23,21,4095
