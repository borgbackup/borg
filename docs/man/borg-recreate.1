.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg recreate <options> REPOSITORY_OR_ARCHIVE PATH
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Recreate the contents of existing archives.
.sp
This is an \fIexperimental\fP feature. Do \fInot\fP use this on your only backup.
.sp
\-\-exclude, \-\-exclude\-from, \-\-exclude\-if\-present, \-\-keep\-exclude\-tags, and PATH
have the exact same semantics as in "borg create". If PATHs are specified the
resulting archive will only contain files from these PATHs.
.sp
Note that all paths in an archive are relative, therefore absolute patterns/paths
will \fInot\fP match (\-\-exclude, \-\-exclude\-from, \-\-compression\-from, PATHs).
.sp
\-\-compression: all chunks seen will be stored using the given method.
Due to how Borg stores compressed size information this might display
incorrect information for archives that were not recreated at the same time.
There is no risk of data loss by this.
.sp
\-\-chunker\-params will re\-chunk all files in the archive, this can be
used to have upgraded Borg 0.xx or Attic archives deduplicate with
Borg 1.x archives.
.sp
USE WITH CAUTION.
Depending on the PATHs and patterns given, recreate can be used to permanently
delete files from archives.
When in doubt, use "\-\-dry\-run \-\-verbose \-\-list" to see how patterns/PATHS are
interpreted.
.sp
The archive being recreated is only removed after the operation completes. The
archive that is built during the operation exists at the same time at
"<ARCHIVE>.recreate". The new archive will have a different archive ID.
.sp
With \-\-target the original archive is not replaced, instead a new archive is created.
.sp
When rechunking space usage can be substantial, expect at least the entire
deduplicated size of the archives using the previous chunker params.
When recompressing expect approx. (throughput / checkpoint\-interval) in space usage,
assuming all chunks are recompressed.

# Make old (Attic / Borg 0.xx) archives deduplicate with Borg 1.x archives
