.TH "BORG-RECREATE" 1 "2022-08-07" "" "borg backup tool"
.SH NAME
borg-recreate \- Re-create archives
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] recreate [options] [PATH...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Recreate the contents of existing archives.
.sp
recreate is a potentially dangerous function and might lead to data loss
(if used wrongly). BE VERY CAREFUL!
.sp
Important: Repository disk space is \fBnot\fP freed until you run \fBborg compact\fP\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-exclude\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-from\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-if\-present\fP, \fB\-\-keep\-exclude\-tags\fP
and PATH have the exact same semantics as in "borg create", but they only check
for files in the archives and not in the local file system. If PATHs are specified,
the resulting archives will only contain files from these PATHs.
.sp
Note that all paths in an archive are relative, therefore absolute patterns/paths
will \fInot\fP match (\fB\-\-exclude\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-from\fP, PATHs).
.sp
\fB\-\-recompress\fP allows one to change the compression of existing data in archives.
Due to how Borg stores compressed size information this might display
incorrect information for archives that were not recreated at the same time.
There is no risk of data loss by this.
.sp
\fB\-\-chunker\-params\fP will re\-chunk all files in the archive, this can be
used to have upgraded Borg 0.xx archives deduplicate with Borg 1.x archives.
.sp
\fBUSE WITH CAUTION.\fP
Depending on the PATHs and patterns given, recreate can be used to permanently
delete files from archives.
When in doubt, use \fB\-\-dry\-run \-\-verbose \-\-list\fP to see how patterns/PATHS are
interpreted. See \fIlist_item_flags\fP in \fBborg create\fP for details.
.sp
The archive being recreated is only removed after the operation completes. The
archive that is built during the operation exists at the same time at
"<ARCHIVE>.recreate". The new archive will have a different archive ID.
.sp
With \fB\-\-target\fP the original archive is not replaced, instead a new archive is created.
.sp
When rechunking (or recompressing), space usage can be substantial \- expect
at least the entire deduplicated size of the archives using the previous
chunker (or compression) params.
.sp
If you recently ran borg check \-\-repair and it had to fix lost chunks with all\-zero
replacement chunks, please first run another backup for the same data and re\-run
borg check \-\-repair afterwards to heal any archives that had lost chunks which are
still generated from the input data.
.sp
Important: running borg recreate to re\-chunk will remove the chunks_healthy
metadata of all items with replacement chunks, so healing will not be possible
any more after re\-chunking (it is also unlikely it would ever work: due to the
change of chunking parameters, the missing chunk likely will never be seen again
even if you still have the data that produced it).
.SH OPTIONS

.UNINDENT
.SS Exclusion options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-e \ PATTERN\fR,\fB \ \-\-exclude \ PATTERN
exclude paths matching PATTERN
.TP
.BI \-\-exclude\-from \ EXCLUDEFILE
read exclude patterns from EXCLUDEFILE, one per line
.TP
.BI \-\-pattern \ PATTERN
include/exclude paths matching PATTERN
.TP
.BI \-\-patterns\-from \ PATTERNFILE
read include/exclude patterns from PATTERNFILE, one per line
.TP
.B  \-\-exclude\-caches
exclude directories that contain a CACHEDIR.TAG file (\fI\%http://www.bford.info/cachedir/spec.html\fP)
.TP
.BI \-\-exclude\-if\-present \ NAME
exclude directories that are tagged by containing a filesystem object with the given NAME
.TP
.B  \-\-keep\-exclude\-tags
if tag objects are specified with \fB\-\-exclude\-if\-present\fP, don\(aqt omit the tag objects themselves from the backup archive
.UNINDENT
.SS Archive filters
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-a \ GLOB\fR,\fB \ \-\-glob\-archives \ GLOB
only consider archive names matching the glob. sh: rules apply, see "borg help patterns".
.TP
.BI \-\-sort\-by \ KEYS
Comma\-separated list of sorting keys; valid keys are: timestamp, name, id; default is: timestamp
.TP
.BI \-\-first \ N
consider first N archives after other filters were applied
.TP
.BI \-\-last \ N
consider last N archives after other filters were applied
.TP
.BI \-\-target \ TARGET
create a new archive with the name ARCHIVE, do not replace existing archive (only applies for a single archive)
.TP
.BI \-c \ SECONDS\fR,\fB \ \-\-checkpoint\-interval \ SECONDS
write checkpoint every SECONDS seconds (Default: 1800)
.TP
.BI \-\-comment \ COMMENT
add a comment text to the archive
.TP
.BI \-\-timestamp \ TIMESTAMP
manually specify the archive creation date/time (UTC, yyyy\-mm\-ddThh:mm:ss format). alternatively, give a reference file/directory.
.TP
.BI \-C \ COMPRESSION\fR,\fB \ \-\-compression \ COMPRESSION
select compression algorithm, see the output of the "borg help compression" command for details.
.TP
.BI \-\-recompress \ MODE
recompress data chunks according to \fIMODE\fP and \fB\-\-compression\fP\&. Possible modes are \fIif\-different\fP: recompress if current compression is with a different compression algorithm or different level; \fIalways\fP: recompress unconditionally; and \fInever\fP: do not recompress (use this option to explicitly prevent recompression). If no MODE is given, \fIif\-different\fP will be used. Not passing \-\-recompress is equivalent to "\-\-recompress never".
.TP
.BI \-\-chunker\-params \ PARAMS
specify the chunker parameters (ALGO, CHUNK_MIN_EXP, CHUNK_MAX_EXP, HASH_MASK_BITS, HASH_WINDOW_SIZE) or \fIdefault\fP to use the current defaults. default: buzhash,19,23,21,4095

# Remove unwanted files from all archives in a repository.
# Note the relative path for the \-\-exclude option \- archives only contain relative paths.
