.TH "BORG-REPO-SPACE" "1" "2025-12-23" "" "borg backup tool"
.SH NAME
borg-repo-space \- Manages reserved space in the repository.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] repo\-space [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This command manages reserved space in a repository.
.sp
Borg cannot work in disk\-full conditions (it cannot lock a repository and thus cannot
run prune/delete or compact operations to free disk space).
.sp
To avoid running into such dead\-end situations, you can put some objects into a
repository that take up disk space. If you ever run into a disk\-full situation, you
can free that space, and then Borg will be able to run normally so you can free more
disk space by using \fBborg prune\fP/\fBborg delete\fP/\fBborg compact\fP\&. After that, do
not forget to reserve space again, in case you run into that situation again later.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Create a new repository:
$ borg repo\-create ...
# Reserve approx. 1 GiB of space for emergencies:
$ borg repo\-space \-\-reserve 1G

# Check the amount of reserved space in the repository:
$ borg repo\-space

# EMERGENCY! Free all reserved space to get things back to normal:
$ borg repo\-space \-\-free
$ borg prune ...
$ borg delete ...
$ borg compact \-v  # only this actually frees space of deleted archives
$ borg repo\-space \-\-reserve 1G  # reserve space again for next time
