.SH NAME
borg-repo-space \- Manage reserved space in repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] repo\-space [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This command manages reserved space in a repository.
.sp
Borg can not work in disk\-full conditions (can not lock a repo and thus can
not run prune/delete or compact operations to free disk space).
.sp
To avoid running into dead\-end situations like that, you can put some objects
into a repository that take up some disk space. If you ever run into a
disk\-full situation, you can free that space and then borg will be able to
run normally, so you can free more disk space by using prune/delete/compact.
After that, don\(aqt forget to reserve space again, in case you run into that
situation again at a later time.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# Create a new repository:
$ borg repo\-create ...
# Reserve approx. 1GB of space for emergencies:
$ borg repo\-space \-\-reserve 1G

# Check amount of reserved space in the repository:
$ borg repo\-space

# EMERGENCY! Free all reserved space to get things back to normal:
$ borg repo\-space \-\-free
$ borg prune ...
$ borg delete ...
$ borg compact \-v  # only this actually frees space of deleted archives
$ borg repo\-space \-\-reserve 1G  # reserve space again for next time
