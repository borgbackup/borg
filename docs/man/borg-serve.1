.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] serve [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This command starts a repository server process. This command is usually not used manually.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
See \fIborg\-common(1)\fP for common options of Borg commands.
.SS optional arguments
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-restrict\-to\-path \ PATH
restrict repository access to PATH. Can be specified multiple times to allow the client access to several directories. Access to all sub\-directories is granted implicitly; PATH doesn\(aqt need to directly point to a repository.
.TP
.BI \-\-restrict\-to\-repository \ PATH
restrict repository access. Only the repository located at PATH (no sub\-directories are considered) is accessible. Can be specified multiple times to allow the client access to several repositories. Unlike \fB\-\-restrict\-to\-path\fP sub\-directories are not accessible; PATH needs to directly point at a repository location. PATH may be an empty directory or the last element of PATH may not exist, in which case the client may initialize a repository there.
.TP
.B \-\-append\-only
only allow appending to repository segment files
.TP
.BI \-\-storage\-quota \ QUOTA
Override storage quota of the repository (e.g. 5G, 1.5T). When a new repository is initialized, sets the storage quota on the new repository as well. Default: no quota.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
borg serve has special support for ssh forced commands (see \fBauthorized_keys\fP
example below): it will detect that you use such a forced command and extract
the value of the \fB\-\-restrict\-to\-path\fP option(s).
.sp
It will then parse the original command that came from the client, makes sure
that it is also \fBborg serve\fP and enforce path restriction(s) as given by the
forced command. That way, other options given by the client (like \fB\-\-info\fP or
\fB\-\-umask\fP) are preserved (and are not fixed by the forced command).
.sp
Environment variables (such as BORG_HOSTNAME_IS_UNIQUE) contained in the original
command sent by the client are \fInot\fP interpreted, but ignored. If BORG_XXX environment
variables should be set on the \fBborg serve\fP side, then these must be set in system\-specific
locations like \fB/etc/environment\fP or in the forced command itself (example below).

.INDENT 3.5
The examples above use the \fBrestrict\fP directive. This does automatically
block potential dangerous ssh features, even when they are added in a future
update. Thus, this option should be preferred.
.sp
If you\(aqre using openssh\-server < 7.2, however, you have to explicitly specify
the ssh features to restrict and cannot simply use the restrict option as it
has been introduced in v7.2. We recommend to use
\fBno\-port\-forwarding,no\-X11\-forwarding,no\-pty,no\-agent\-forwarding,no\-user\-rc\fP
in this case.
