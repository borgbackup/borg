.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-restrict\-to\-path \ PATH

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
borg serve has special support for ssh forced commands (see \fBauthorized_keys\fP
example below): it will detect that you use such a forced command and extract
the value of the \fB\-\-restrict\-to\-path\fP option(s).
It will then parse the original command that came from the client, makes sure
that it is also \fBborg serve\fP and enforce path restriction(s) as given by the
forced command. That way, other options given by the client (like \fB\-\-info\fP or
\fB\-\-umask\fP) are preserved (and are not fixed by the forced command).

# Allow an SSH keypair to only run borg, and only have access to /path/to/repo.
# Use key options to disable unneeded and potentially dangerous SSH functionality.
# This will help to secure an automated remote backup system.
