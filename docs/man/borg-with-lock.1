running in the repo), then execute the given command as a subprocess and wait
for its termination, release the lock and return the user command\(aqs return
code as borg\(aqs return code.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Note: if you copy a repository with the lock held, the lock will be present in
the copy, obviously. Thus, before using borg on the copy, you need to
use "borg break\-lock" on it.
