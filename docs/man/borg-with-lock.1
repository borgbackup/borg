.SH NAME
borg-with-lock \- run a user specified command with the repository lock held
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] with\-lock [options] COMMAND [ARGS...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This command runs a user\-specified command while the repository lock is held.
.sp
It will first try to acquire the lock (make sure that no other operation is
running in the repo), then execute the given command as a subprocess and wait
for its termination, release the lock and return the user command\(aqs return
code as borg\(aqs return code.

.INDENT 3.5
If you copy a repository with the lock held, the lock will be present in
the copy. Thus, before using borg on the copy from a different host,
you need to use \(dqborg break\-lock\(dq on the copied repository, because
Borg is cautious and does not automatically remove stale locks made by a different host.
