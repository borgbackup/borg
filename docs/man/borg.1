.SH NAME
borg \- deduplicating and encrypting backup tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borg [common options] <command> [options] [arguments]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" we don't include the README.rst here since we want to keep this terse.
.
.sp
BorgBackup (short: Borg) is a deduplicating backup program.
Optionally, it supports compression and authenticated encryption.
.sp
The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to backup data.
The data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable for daily backups
since only changes are stored.
The authenticated encryption technique makes it suitable for backups to not
fully trusted targets.
.sp
Borg stores a set of files in an \fIarchive\fP\&. A \fIrepository\fP is a collection
of \fIarchives\fP\&. The format of repositories is Borg\-specific. Borg does not
distinguish archives from each other in any way other than their name,
it does not matter when or where archives were created (e.g. different hosts).
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS A step\-by\-step example
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Before a backup can be made a repository has to be initialized:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ borg \-r /path/to/repo rcreate \-\-encryption=repokey\-aes\-ocb
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP 2. 3
Backup the \fB~/src\fP and \fB~/Documents\fP directories into an archive called
\fIMonday\fP:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ borg \-r /path/to/repo create Monday ~/src ~/Documents
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP 3. 3
The next day create a new archive called \fITuesday\fP:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ borg \-r /path/to/repo create \-\-stats Tuesday ~/src ~/Documents
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This backup will be a lot quicker and a lot smaller since only new never
before seen data is stored. The \fB\-\-stats\fP option causes Borg to
output statistics about the newly created archive such as the deduplicated
size (the amount of unique data not shared with other archives):
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

Please note the \fB\-a\fP option here (short for \fB\-\-glob\-archives\fP) which enables you
to give a globbing pattern to delete multiple archives, like \fB\-a \(aqoldcrap\-*\(aq\fP\&.
You can also combine this with \fB\-\-first\fP, \fB\-\-last\fP and \fB\-\-sort\-by\fP\&.
Be careful, always first use with \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP and \fB\-\-list\fP!

.INDENT 3.5
Borg is quiet by default (it works on WARNING log level).
You can use options like \fB\-\-progress\fP or \fB\-\-list\fP to get specific
reports during command execution.  You can also add the \fB\-v\fP (or
\fB\-\-verbose\fP or \fB\-\-info\fP) option to adjust the log level to INFO to
get other informational messages.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH NOTES
.SS Positional Arguments and Options: Order matters
.sp
Borg only supports taking options (\fB\-s\fP and \fB\-\-progress\fP in the example)
to the left or right of all positional arguments (\fBrepo::archive\fP and \fBpath\fP
in the example), but not in between them:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
borg create \-s \-\-progress archive path  # good and preferred
borg create archive path \-s \-\-progress  # also works
borg create \-s archive path \-\-progress  # works, but ugly
borg create archive \-s \-\-progress path  # BAD
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is due to a problem in the argparse module: \fI\%https://bugs.python.org/issue15112\fP
.SS Repository URLs
.sp
\fBLocal filesystem\fP (or locally mounted network filesystem):
.sp
\fB/path/to/repo\fP \- filesystem path to repo directory, absolute path
.sp
\fBpath/to/repo\fP \- filesystem path to repo directory, relative path
.sp
Also, stuff like \fB~/path/to/repo\fP or \fB~other/path/to/repo\fP works (this is
expanded by your shell).
.sp
Note: you may also prepend a \fBfile://\fP to a filesystem path to get URL style.
.sp
\fBRemote repositories\fP accessed via ssh \fI\%user@host\fP:
.sp
\fBssh://user@host:port/path/to/repo\fP \- absolute path\(ga
.sp
\fBssh://user@host:port/./path/to/repo\fP \- path relative to current directory
.sp
\fBssh://user@host:port/~/path/to/repo\fP \- path relative to user\(aqs home directory
.sp
If you frequently need the same repo URL, it is a good idea to set the
\fBBORG_REPO\fP environment variable to set a default for the repo URL:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export BORG_REPO=\(aqssh://user@host:port/path/to/repo\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then just leave away the \fB\-\-repo\fP option if you want
to use the default \- it will be read from BORG_REPO then.
.SS Repository Locations / Archive names
.sp
Many commands need to know the repository location, give it via \fB\-r\fP / \fB\-\-repo\fP
or use the \fBBORG_REPO\fP environment variable.
.sp
Commands needing one or two archive names usually get them as positional argument.
.sp
Commands working with an arbitrary amount of archives, usually take \fB\-a ARCH_GLOB\fP\&.
.sp
Archive names must not contain the \fB/\fP (slash) character. For simplicity,
maybe also avoid blanks or other characters that have special meaning on the
shell or in a filesystem (borg mount will use the archive name as directory
name).
.SS Logging
.sp
Borg writes all log output to stderr by default. But please note that something
showing up on stderr does \fInot\fP indicate an error condition just because it is
on stderr. Please check the log levels of the messages and the return code of
borg for determining error, warning or success conditions.
.sp
If you want to capture the log output to a file, just redirect it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
borg create repo::archive myfiles 2>> logfile
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Custom logging configurations can be implemented via BORG_LOGGING_CONF.
.sp
The log level of the builtin logging configuration defaults to WARNING.
This is because we want Borg to be mostly silent and only output
warnings, errors and critical messages, unless output has been requested
by supplying an option that implies output (e.g. \fB\-\-list\fP or \fB\-\-progress\fP).
.sp
Log levels: DEBUG < INFO < WARNING < ERROR < CRITICAL
.sp
Use \fB\-\-debug\fP to set DEBUG log level \-
to get debug, info, warning, error and critical level output.
.sp
Use \fB\-\-info\fP (or \fB\-v\fP or \fB\-\-verbose\fP) to set INFO log level \-
to get info, warning, error and critical level output.
.sp
Use \fB\-\-warning\fP (default) to set WARNING log level \-
to get warning, error and critical level output.
.sp
Use \fB\-\-error\fP to set ERROR log level \-
to get error and critical level output.
.sp
Use \fB\-\-critical\fP to set CRITICAL log level \-
to get critical level output.
.sp
While you can set misc. log levels, do not expect that every command will
give different output on different log levels \- it\(aqs just a possibility.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Options \fB\-\-critical\fP and \fB\-\-error\fP are provided for completeness,
their usage is not recommended as you might miss important information.
.UNINDENT

.SS Return codes
.sp
Borg can exit with the following return codes (rc):
.TS
center;
|l|l|.
_
T{
Return code
T}	T{
Meaning
T}
_
T{
0
T}	T{
success (logged as INFO)
T}

T}	T{
warning (operation reached its normal end, but there were warnings \-\-
you should check the log, logged as WARNING)
T}
_
T{
2
T}	T{
error (like a fatal error, a local or remote exception, the operation
did not reach its normal end, logged as ERROR)
T}
_
T{
128+N
T}	T{
killed by signal N (e.g. 137 == kill \-9)
T}
_
.TE
.sp
If you use \fB\-\-show\-rc\fP, the return code is also logged at the indicated
level as the last log entry.
.SS Environment Variables
.sp
Borg uses some environment variables for automation:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B General:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B BORG_REPO
When set, use the value to give the default repository location.
Use this so you do not need to type \fB\-\-repo /path/to/my/repo\fP all the time.
.TP
.B BORG_OTHER_REPO
Similar to BORG_REPO, but gives the default for \fB\-\-other\-repo\fP\&.
.TP
.B BORG_PASSPHRASE
When set, use the value to answer the passphrase question for encrypted repositories.
It is used when a passphrase is needed to access an encrypted repo as well as when a new
passphrase should be initially set when initializing an encrypted repo.
See also BORG_NEW_PASSPHRASE.
.TP
.B BORG_PASSCOMMAND
When set, use the standard output of the command (trailing newlines are stripped) to answer the
passphrase question for encrypted repositories.
It is used when a passphrase is needed to access an encrypted repo as well as when a new
passphrase should be initially set when initializing an encrypted repo. Note that the command
is executed without a shell. So variables, like \fB$HOME\fP will work, but \fB~\fP won\(aqt.
If BORG_PASSPHRASE is also set, it takes precedence.
See also BORG_NEW_PASSPHRASE.
.TP
.B BORG_PASSPHRASE_FD
When set, specifies a file descriptor to read a passphrase
from. Programs starting borg may choose to open an anonymous pipe
and use it to pass a passphrase. This is safer than passing via
BORG_PASSPHRASE, because on some systems (e.g. Linux) environment
can be examined by other processes.
If BORG_PASSPHRASE or BORG_PASSCOMMAND are also set, they take precedence.
.TP
.B BORG_NEW_PASSPHRASE
When set, use the value to answer the passphrase question when a \fBnew\fP passphrase is asked for.
This variable is checked first. If it is not set, BORG_PASSPHRASE and BORG_PASSCOMMAND will also
be checked.
Main usecase for this is to fully automate \fBborg change\-passphrase\fP\&.
.TP
.B BORG_DISPLAY_PASSPHRASE
When set, use the value to answer the "display the passphrase for verification" question when defining a new passphrase for encrypted repositories.
.TP
.B BORG_HOST_ID
Borg usually computes a host id from the FQDN plus the results of \fBuuid.getnode()\fP (which usually returns
a unique id based on the MAC address of the network interface. Except if that MAC happens to be all\-zero \- in
that case it returns a random value, which is not what we want (because it kills automatic stale lock removal).
So, if you have a all\-zero MAC address or other reasons to better externally control the host id, just set this
environment variable to a unique value. If all your FQDNs are unique, you can just use the FQDN. If not,
use \fI\%fqdn@uniqueid\fP\&.
.TP
.B BORG_LOGGING_CONF
When set, use the given filename as \fI\%INI\fP\-style logging configuration.
A basic example conf can be found at \fBdocs/misc/logging.conf\fP\&.
.TP
.B BORG_RSH
When set, use this command instead of \fBssh\fP\&. This can be used to specify ssh options, such as
a custom identity file \fBssh \-i /path/to/private/key\fP\&. See \fBman ssh\fP for other options. Using
the \fB\-\-rsh CMD\fP commandline option overrides the environment variable.
.TP
.B BORG_REMOTE_PATH
When set, use the given path as borg executable on the remote (defaults to "borg" if unset).
Using \fB\-\-remote\-path PATH\fP commandline option overrides the environment variable.
.TP
.B BORG_FILES_CACHE_SUFFIX
When set to a value at least one character long, instructs borg to use a specifically named
(based on the suffix) alternative files cache. This can be used to avoid loading and saving
cache entries for backup sources other than the current sources.
.TP
.B BORG_FILES_CACHE_TTL
When set to a numeric value, this determines the maximum "time to live" for the files cache
entries (default: 20). The files cache is used to quickly determine whether a file is unchanged.
The FAQ explains this more detailed in: \fIalways_chunking\fP
.TP
.B BORG_SHOW_SYSINFO
When set to no (default: yes), system information (like OS, Python version, ...) in
exceptions is not shown.
Please only use for good reasons as it makes issues harder to analyze.
.TP
.B BORG_FUSE_IMPL
Choose the lowlevel FUSE implementation borg shall use for \fBborg mount\fP\&.
This is a comma\-separated list of implementation names, they are tried in the
given order, e.g.:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpyfuse3,llfuse\fP: default, first try to load pyfuse3, then try to load llfuse.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBllfuse,pyfuse3\fP: first try to load llfuse, then try to load pyfuse3.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpyfuse3\fP: only try to load pyfuse3
.IP \(bu 2
\fBllfuse\fP: only try to load llfuse
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnone\fP: do not try to load an implementation
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B BORG_SELFTEST
This can be used to influence borg\(aqs builtin self\-tests. The default is to execute the tests
at the beginning of each borg command invocation.
.sp
BORG_SELFTEST=disabled can be used to switch off the tests and rather save some time.
Disabling is not recommended for normal borg users, but large scale borg storage providers can
use this to optimize production servers after at least doing a one\-time test borg (with
selftests not disabled) when installing or upgrading machines / OS / borg.
.TP
.B BORG_WORKAROUNDS
A list of comma separated strings that trigger workarounds in borg,
e.g. to work around bugs in other software.
.sp
Currently known strings are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B basesyncfile
Use the more simple BaseSyncFile code to avoid issues with sync_file_range.
You might need this to run borg on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or
in systemd.nspawn containers on some architectures (e.g. ARM).
Using this does not affect data safety, but might result in a more bursty
write to disk behaviour (not continuously streaming to disk).
.TP
.B retry_erofs
Retry opening a file without O_NOATIME if opening a file with O_NOATIME
caused EROFS. You will need this to make archives from volume shadow copies
in WSL1 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 1).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B Some automatic "answerers" (if set, they automatically answer confirmation questions):
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B BORG_UNKNOWN_UNENCRYPTED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK=no (or =yes)
For "Warning: Attempting to access a previously unknown unencrypted repository"
.TP
.B BORG_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK=no (or =yes)
For "Warning: The repository at location ... was previously located at ..."
.TP
.B BORG_CHECK_I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING=NO (or =YES)
For "This is a potentially dangerous function..." (check \-\-repair)
.TP
.B BORG_DELETE_I_KNOW_WHAT_I_AM_DOING=NO (or =YES)
For "You requested to completely DELETE the repository \fIincluding\fP all archives it contains:"
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note: answers are case sensitive. setting an invalid answer value might either give the default
answer or ask you interactively, depending on whether retries are allowed (they by default are
allowed). So please test your scripts interactively before making them a non\-interactive script.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Directories and files:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B BORG_BASE_DIR
Defaults to \fB$HOME\fP or \fB~$USER\fP or \fB~\fP (in that order).
If you want to move all borg\-specific folders to a custom path at once, all you need to do is
to modify \fBBORG_BASE_DIR\fP: the other paths for cache, config etc. will adapt accordingly
(assuming you didn\(aqt set them to a different custom value).
.TP
.B BORG_CACHE_DIR
Defaults to \fB$BORG_BASE_DIR/.cache/borg\fP\&. If \fBBORG_BASE_DIR\fP is not explicitly set while
\fI\%XDG env var\fP \fBXDG_CACHE_HOME\fP is set, then \fB$XDG_CACHE_HOME/borg\fP is being used instead.
This directory contains the local cache and might need a lot
of space for dealing with big repositories. Make sure you\(aqre aware of the associated
security aspects of the cache location: \fIcache_security\fP
.TP
.B BORG_CONFIG_DIR
Defaults to \fB$BORG_BASE_DIR/.config/borg\fP\&. If \fBBORG_BASE_DIR\fP is not explicitly set while
\fI\%XDG env var\fP \fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP is set, then \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/borg\fP is being used instead.
This directory contains all borg configuration directories, see the FAQ
for a security advisory about the data in this directory: \fIhome_config_borg\fP
.TP
.B BORG_SECURITY_DIR
Defaults to \fB$BORG_CONFIG_DIR/security\fP\&.
This directory contains information borg uses to track its usage of NONCES ("numbers used
once" \- usually in encryption context) and other security relevant data.
.TP
.B BORG_KEYS_DIR
Defaults to \fB$BORG_CONFIG_DIR/keys\fP\&.
This directory contains keys for encrypted repositories.
.TP
.B BORG_KEY_FILE
When set, use the given filename as repository key file.
.TP
.B TMPDIR
This is where temporary files are stored (might need a lot of temporary space for some
operations), see \fI\%tempfile\fP for details.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B Building:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B BORG_OPENSSL_PREFIX
Adds given OpenSSL header file directory to the default locations (setup.py).
.TP
.B BORG_LIBLZ4_PREFIX
Adds given prefix directory to the default locations. If a \(aqinclude/lz4.h\(aq is found Borg
will be linked against the system liblz4 instead of a bundled implementation. (setup.py)
.TP
.B BORG_LIBB2_PREFIX
Adds given prefix directory to the default locations. If a \(aqinclude/blake2.h\(aq is found Borg
will be linked against the system libb2 instead of a bundled implementation. (setup.py)
.TP
.B BORG_LIBZSTD_PREFIX
Adds given prefix directory to the default locations. If a \(aqinclude/zstd.h\(aq is found Borg
will be linked against the system libzstd instead of a bundled implementation. (setup.py)

.UNINDENT
.sp
Please note:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Be very careful when using the "yes" sayers, the warnings with prompt exist for your / your data\(aqs security/safety.
.IP \(bu 2
Also be very careful when putting your passphrase into a script, make sure it has appropriate file permissions (e.g.
mode 600, root:root).
.UNINDENT
.SS File systems
.sp
We strongly recommend against using Borg (or any other database\-like
software) on non\-journaling file systems like FAT, since it is not
possible to assume any consistency in case of power failures (or a
sudden disconnect of an external drive or similar failures).
.sp
While Borg uses a data store that is resilient against these failures
when used on journaling file systems, it is not possible to guarantee
this with some hardware \-\- independent of the software used. We don\(aqt
know a list of affected hardware.
.sp
If you are suspicious whether your Borg repository is still consistent
and readable after one of the failures mentioned above occurred, run
\fBborg check \-\-verify\-data\fP to make sure it is consistent.
Requirements for Borg repository file systems
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Long file names
.IP \(bu 2
At least three directory levels with short names
.IP \(bu 2
Typically, file sizes up to a few hundred MB.
Large repositories may require large files (>2 GB).
.IP \(bu 2
Up to 1000 files per directory (10000 for repositories initialized with Borg 1.0)
.IP \(bu 2
rename(2) / MoveFile(Ex) should work as specified, i.e. on the same file system
it should be a move (not a copy) operation, and in case of a directory
it should fail if the destination exists and is not an empty directory,
since this is used for locking.
.IP \(bu 2
Also hardlinks are used for more safe and secure file updating (e.g. of the repo
config file), but the code tries to work also if hardlinks are not supported.
.UNINDENT
.SS Units
.sp
To display quantities, Borg takes care of respecting the
usual conventions of scale. Disk sizes are displayed in \fI\%decimal\fP, using powers of ten (so
\fBkB\fP means 1000 bytes). For memory usage, \fI\%binary prefixes\fP are used, and are
indicated using the \fI\%IEC binary prefixes\fP,
using powers of two (so \fBKiB\fP means 1024 bytes).
.SS Date and Time
.sp
We format date and time conforming to ISO\-8601, that is: YYYY\-MM\-DD and
HH:MM:SS (24h clock).
.sp
For more information about that, see: \fI\%https://xkcd.com/1179/\fP
.sp
Unless otherwise noted, we display local date and time.
Internally, we store and process date and time as UTC.
.SS Resource Usage
.sp
Borg might use a lot of resources depending on the size of the data set it is dealing with.
.sp
If one uses Borg in a client/server way (with a ssh: repository),
the resource usage occurs in part on the client and in another part on the
server.
.sp
If one uses Borg as a single process (with a filesystem repo),
all the resource usage occurs in that one process, so just add up client +
server to get the approximate resource usage.

It won\(aqt go beyond 100% of 1 core as the code is currently single\-threaded.

It usually doesn\(aqt need much CPU, it just deals with the key/value store
(repository) and uses the repository index for that.
.sp
borg check: the repository check computes the checksums of all chunks
(medium CPU usage)
borg delete repo: low CPU usage
.TP
.B CPU (only for client/server operation):
When using borg in a client/server way with a \fI\%ssh:\-type\fP repo, the ssh
processes used for the transport layer will need some CPU on the client and
on the server due to the crypto they are doing \- esp. if you are pumping
big amounts of data.
.TP
.B Memory (RAM) client:
The chunks index and the files index are read into memory for performance
reasons. Might need big amounts of memory (see below).
Compression, esp. lzma compression with high levels might need substantial
amounts of memory.
.TP
.B Memory (RAM) server:
The server process will load the repository index into memory. Might need
considerable amounts of memory, but less than on the client (see below).
.TP
.B Chunks index (client only):
Proportional to the amount of data chunks in your repo. Lots of chunks
in your repo imply a big chunks index.
It is possible to tweak the chunker params (see create options).
.TP
.B Files index (client only):
Proportional to the amount of files in your last backups. Can be switched
off (see create options), but next backup might be much slower if you do.
The speed benefit of using the files cache is proportional to file size.
.TP
.B Repository index (server only):
Proportional to the amount of data chunks in your repo. Lots of chunks
in your repo imply a big repository index.
It is possible to tweak the chunker params (see create options) to
influence the amount of chunks being created.
.TP
.B Temporary files (client):
Reading data and metadata from a FUSE mounted repository will consume up to
the size of all deduplicated, small chunks in the repository. Big chunks
won\(aqt be locally cached.
.TP
.B Temporary files (server):
A non\-trivial amount of data will be stored on the remote temp directory
for each client that connects to it. For some remotes, this can fill the
default temporary directory at /tmp. This can be remediated by ensuring the
$TMPDIR, $TEMP, or $TMP environment variable is properly set for the sshd
process.
For some OSes, this can be done just by setting the correct value in the
\&.bashrc (or equivalent login config file for other shells), however in
other cases it may be necessary to first enable \fBPermitUserEnvironment yes\fP
in your \fBsshd_config\fP file, then add \fBenvironment="TMPDIR=/my/big/tmpdir"\fP
at the start of the public key to be used in the \fBauthorized_hosts\fP file.
.TP
.B Cache files (client only):
Contains the chunks index and files index (plus a collection of single\-
archive chunk indexes which might need huge amounts of disk space,
depending on archive count and size \- see FAQ about how to reduce).
.TP
.B Network (only for client/server operation):
If your repository is remote, all deduplicated (and optionally compressed/
encrypted) data of course has to go over the connection (\fBssh://\fP repo url).
If you use a locally mounted network filesystem, additionally some copy
operations used for transaction support also go over the connection. If
you backup multiple sources to one target repository, additional traffic
happens for cache resynchronization.

Note that most of the platform\-dependent features also depend on the file system.
For example, ntfs\-3g on Linux isn\(aqt able to convey NTFS ACLs.

Cygwin tries to map NTFS ACLs to permissions with varying degrees of success.
.IP [5] 5
The native access control list mechanism of the OS. This normally limits access to
non\-native ACLs. For example, NTFS ACLs aren\(aqt completely accessible on Linux with ntfs\-3g.
