.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
borgfs [options] REPOSITORY_OR_ARCHIVE MOUNTPOINT [PATH...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This command mounts an archive as a FUSE filesystem. This can be useful for
browsing an archive or restoring individual files. Unless the \fB\-\-foreground\fP
option is given the command will run in the background until the filesystem
is \fBumounted\fP\&.
.sp
The command \fBborgfs\fP provides a wrapper for \fBborg mount\fP\&. This can also be
used in fstab entries:
\fB/path/to/repo /mnt/point fuse.borgfs defaults,noauto 0 0\fP
.sp
To allow a regular user to use fstab entries, add the \fBuser\fP option:
\fB/path/to/repo /mnt/point fuse.borgfs defaults,noauto,user 0 0\fP
.sp
For FUSE configuration and mount options, see the mount.fuse(8) manual page.
.sp
Additional mount options supported by borg:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
versions: when used with a repository mount, this gives a merged, versioned
view of the files in the archives. EXPERIMENTAL, layout may change in future.
.IP \(bu 2
allow_damaged_files: by default damaged files (where missing chunks were
replaced with runs of zeros by borg check \fB\-\-repair\fP) are not readable and
return EIO (I/O error). Set this option to read such files.
.IP \(bu 2
ignore_permissions: for security reasons the "default_permissions" mount
option is internally enforced by borg. "ignore_permissions" can be given to
not enforce "default_permissions".
.UNINDENT
.sp
The BORG_MOUNT_DATA_CACHE_ENTRIES environment variable is meant for advanced users
to tweak the performance. It sets the number of cached data chunks; additional
memory usage can be up to ~8 MiB times this number. The default is the number
of CPU cores.
.sp
When the daemonized process receives a signal or crashes, it does not unmount.
Unmounting in these cases could cause an active rsync or similar process
to unintentionally delete data.
.sp
When running in the foreground ^C/SIGINT unmounts cleanly, but other
signals or crashes do not.
