borg prune visualized
=====================

To understand prune, it helps to substitute the term `prune` with `delete all backups but keep the latest backup of the x and those of the last nx's that have backups`, and then simply replace `x` with the time frame (secondly, minutely, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly), and replace `n` with a number (1, 2, 3, etc.). 
So `prune --keep-daily 7` means `delete all backups but keep the latest backup of the day and those of the last 7 days that have backups`.
Similarly, `--keep-monthly 6` means `delete all backups but keep the latest backup of the month and those of the last 6 months that have backups`.

Assume you started using borg on 2015-01-01.
You created one backup on each day in 2015 except on 2015-12-19 (no
backup made on that day)
It is 2016-01-01, and today's backup has not yet been made.

This is what borg prune --keep-daily 14 --keep-monthly 6 --keep-yearly 1
would keep.

Backups kept by the --keep-daily rule are marked by a "d" to the right,
backups kept by the --keep-monthly rule are marked by a "m" to the right,
and backups kept by the --keep-yearly rule are marked by a "y" to the
right.

Notes
-----

2015-12-31 is kept due to the --keep-daily 14 rule (because it is applied
first), not due to the --keep-monthly or --keep-yearly rule.

The --keep-yearly 1 rule does not consider the December 31st backup because it
has already been kept due to the daily rule. There are no backups available
from previous years, so the --keep-yearly target of 1 backup is not satisfied.
Because of this, the 2015-01-01 archive (the oldest archive available) is kept.

The --keep-monthly 6 rule keeps Nov, Oct, Sep, Aug, Jul and Jun. December is
not considered for this rule, because that backup was already kept because of
the daily rule.

2015-12-17 is kept to satisfy the --keep-daily 14 rule - because no backup was
made on 2015-12-19. If a backup had been made on that day, it would not keep
the one from 2015-12-17.

We did not include weekly, hourly, minutely or secondly rules to keep this
example simple. They all work in basically the same way.

The weekly rule is easy to understand roughly, but hard to understand in all
details. If interested, read "ISO 8601:2000 standard week-based year".
