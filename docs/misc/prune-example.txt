borg prune visualized
=====================

Assume it is 2016-01-01, today's backup has not yet been made, you have
created at least one backup on each day in 2015 except on 2015-12-19 (no
backup made on that day), and you started backing up with borg on
2015-01-01.

This is what borg prune --keep-daily 14 --keep-monthly 6 --keep-yearly 1
would keep.

Backups kept by the --keep-daily rule are marked by a "d" to the right,
backups kept by the --keep-monthly rule are marked by a "m" to the right,
and backups kept by the --keep-yearly rule are marked by a "y" to the
right.

Notes
-----

2015-12-31 is kept due to the --keep-daily 14 rule (because it is applied
first), not due to the --keep-monthly or --keep-yearly rule.

The --keep-yearly 1 rule does not consider the December 31st backup because it
has already been kept due to the daily rule. There are no backups available
from previous years, so the --keep-yearly target of 1 backup is not satisfied.
Because of this, the 2015-01-01 archive (the oldest archive available) is kept.

The --keep-monthly 6 rule keeps Nov, Oct, Sep, Aug, Jul and Jun. December is
not considered for this rule, because that backup was already kept because of
the daily rule.

2015-12-17 is kept to satisfy the --keep-daily 14 rule - because no backup was
made on 2015-12-19. If a backup had been made on that day, it would not keep
the one from 2015-12-17.

We did not include weekly, hourly, minutely or secondly rules to keep this
example simple. They all work in basically the same way.

The weekly rule is easy to understand roughly, but hard to understand in all
details. If interested, read "ISO 8601:2000 standard week-based year".

The 13weekly and 3monthly rules are two different strategies for keeping one
every quarter of a year. There are `multiple ways` to define a quarter-year;
borg prune recognizes two:

* --keep-13weekly keeps one backup every 13 weeks using ISO 8601:2000's
  definition of the week-based year. January 4th is always included in the
  first week of a year, and January 1st to 3rd may be in week 52 or 53 of the
  previous year. Week 53 is also in the fourth quarter of the year.
* --keep-3monthly keeps one backup every 3 months. January 1st to
  March 31, April 1st to June 30th, July 1st to September 30th, and October 1st
  to December 31st form the quarters.

If the subtleties of the definition of a quarter year don't matter to you, a
short summary of behavior is:

* --keep-13weekly favors keeping backups at the beginning of Jan, Apr, July,
  and Oct.
* --keep-3monthly favors keeping backups at the end of Dec, Mar, Jun, and Sept.
* Both strategies will have some overlap in which backups are kept.
* The differences are negligible unless backups considered for deletion were
  created weekly or more frequently.
