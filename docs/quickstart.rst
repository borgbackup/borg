Quick Start
===========

This chapter will get you started with |project_name| and covers
various use cases.

A step by step example
----------------------

.. include:: quickstart_example.rst.inc

Archives and repositories
-------------------------

A *Borg archive* is the result of a single backup (``borg create``). An archive
stores a snapshot of the data of the files "inside" it. One can later extract or
mount an archive to restore from a backup.

*Repositories* are filesystem directories acting as self-contained stores of archives.
Repositories can be accessed locally via path or remotely via ssh. Under the hood,
repositories contain data blocks and a manifest tracking which blocks are in each
archive. If some data hasn't changed from one backup to another, Borg can simply
reference an already uploaded data chunk (deduplication).

Important note about free space
-------------------------------

Before you start creating backups, please make sure that there is *always*
a good amount of free space on the filesystem that has your backup repository
(and also on ~/.cache). A few GB should suffice for most hard-drive sized
repositories. See also :ref:`cache-memory-usage`.

Borg doesn't use space reserved for root on repository disks (even when run as root),
on file systems which do not support this mechanism (e.g. XFS) we recommend to reserve
some space in Borg itself just to be safe by adjusting the ``additional_free_space``
setting (a good starting point is ``2G``)::

    borg config /path/to/repo additional_free_space 2G

If |project_name| runs out of disk space, it tries to free as much space as it
can while aborting the current operation safely, which allows to free more space
by deleting/pruning archives. This mechanism is not bullet-proof in some
circumstances [1]_.

If you *really* run out of disk space, it can be hard or impossible to free space,
because |project_name| needs free space to operate - even to delete backup
archives.

You can use some monitoring process or just include the free space information
in your backup log files (you check them regularly anyway, right?).

Also helpful:

- create a big file as a "space reserve", that you can delete to free space
- if you use LVM: use a LV + a filesystem that you can resize later and have
  some unallocated PEs you can add to the LV.
- consider using quotas
- use `prune` regularly

.. [1] This failsafe can fail in these circumstances:

    - The underlying file system doesn't support statvfs(2), or returns incorrect
      data, or the repository doesn't reside on a single file system
    - Other tasks fill the disk simultaneously
    - Hard quotas (which may not be reflected in statvfs(2))

Important note about permissions
--------------------------------

Using root likely will be required if you want to backup files of other users
or the operating system. If you only back up your own files, you neither need
nor want to use root.

Avoid to create a mixup of users and permissions in your repository (or cache).

This can easily happen if you run borg using different user accounts (e.g. your
non-privileged user and root) while accessing the same repo.

Of course, a non-root user will have no permission to work with the files
created by root (or another user) and borg operations will just fail with
`Permission denied`.

The easy way to avoid this is to always access the repo as the same user:

For a local repository just always invoke borg as same user.

For a remote repository: always use e.g. borg@remote_host. You can use this
from different local users, the remote user accessing the repo will always be
borg.

If you need to access a local repository from different users, you can use the
same method by using ssh to borg@localhost.

Automating backups
------------------

The following example script is meant to be run daily by the ``root`` user on
different local machines. It backs up a machine's important files (but not the
complete operating system) to a repository ``~/backup/main``  on a remote server.
Some files which aren't necessarily needed in this backup are excluded. See
:ref:`borg_patterns` on how to add more exclude options.

After the backup this script also uses the :ref:`borg_prune` subcommand to keep
only a certain number of old archives and deletes the others in order to preserve
disk space.

Before running, make sure that the repository is initialized as documented in
:ref:`remote_repos` and that the script has the correct permissions to be executable
by the root user, but not executable or readable by anyone else, i.e. root:root 0700.

You can use this script as a starting point and modify it where it's necessary to fit
your setup.

Do not forget to test your created backups to make sure everything you need is being
backed up and that the ``prune`` command is keeping and deleting the correct backups.

    if [ ${global_exit} -gt 1 ];
    then
        info "Backup and/or Prune finished with an error"
    fi

    exit ${global_exit}

Pitfalls with shell variables and environment variables
-------------------------------------------------------

This applies to all environment variables you want borg to see, not just
``BORG_PASSPHRASE``. The short explanation is: always ``export`` your variable,
and use single quotes if you're unsure of the details of your shell's expansion
behavior. E.g.::

    export BORG_PASSPHRASE='complicated & long'

This is because ``export`` exposes variables to subprocesses, which borg may be
one of. More on ``export`` can be found in the "ENVIRONMENT" section of the
bash(1) man page.

Beware of how ``sudo`` interacts with environment variables. For example, you
may be surprised that the following ``export`` has no effect on your command::

   export BORG_PASSPHRASE='complicated & long'
   sudo ./yourborgwrapper.sh  # still prompts for password

For more information, refer to the sudo(8) man page and ``env_keep`` in
the sudoers(5) man page.

.. Tip::
    To debug what your borg process is actually seeing, find its PID
    (``ps aux|grep borg``) and then look into ``/proc/<PID>/environ``.

.. backup_compression:

Backup compression
------------------

The default is lz4 (very fast, but low compression ratio), but other methods are
supported for different situations.

You can use zstd for a wide range from high speed (and relatively low
compression) using N=1 to high compression (and lower speed) using N=22.

zstd is a modern compression algorithm and might be preferable over zlib and
lzma, except if you need compatibility to older borg versions (< 1.1.4) that
did not yet offer zstd.

    $ borg create --compression zstd,N /path/to/repo::arch ~

Other options are:

If you have a fast repo storage and you want minimum CPU usage, no compression::

    $ borg create --compression none /path/to/repo::arch ~

If you have a less fast repo storage and you want a bit more compression (N=0..9,
0 means no compression, 9 means high compression): ::

    $ borg create --compression zlib,N /path/to/repo::arch ~

If you have a very slow repo storage and you want high compression (N=0..9, 0 means
low compression, 9 means high compression): ::

    $ borg create --compression lzma,N /path/to/repo::arch ~

You'll need to experiment a bit to find the best compression for your use case.
Keep an eye on CPU load and throughput.

.. _encrypted_repos:

Repository encryption
---------------------

You can choose the repository encryption mode at repository creation time::

    $ borg init --encryption=MODE PATH

For a list of available encryption MODEs and their descriptions, please refer
to :ref:`borg_init`.

If you use encryption, all data is encrypted on the client before being written
to the repository.
This means that an attacker who manages to compromise the host containing an
encrypted repository will not be able to access any of the data, even while the
backup is being made.

Key material is stored in encrypted form and can be only decrypted by providing
the correct passphrase.

For automated backups the passphrase can be specified using the
`BORG_PASSPHRASE` environment variable.

.. note:: Be careful about how you set that environment, see
          :ref:`this note about password environments <password_env>`
          for more information.

.. warning:: The repository data is totally inaccessible without the key
    and the key passphrase.

    Make a backup copy of the key file (``keyfile`` mode) or repo config
    file (``repokey`` mode) and keep it at a safe place, so you still have
    the key in case it gets corrupted or lost. Also keep your passphrase
    at a safe place.

    You can make backups using :ref:`borg_key_export` subcommand.

    If you want to print a backup of your key to paper use the ``--paper``
    option of this command and print the result, or this print `template`_
    if you need a version with QR-Code.

    A backup inside of the backup that is encrypted with that key/passphrase
    won't help you with that, of course.

.. _template: paperkey.html

.. _remote_repos:

Remote repositories
-------------------

|project_name| can initialize and access repositories on remote hosts if the
host is accessible using SSH.  This is fastest and easiest when |project_name|
is installed on the remote host, in which case the following syntax is used::

  $ borg init user@hostname:/path/to/repo

Note: please see the usage chapter for a full documentation of repo URLs.

Remote operations over SSH can be automated with SSH keys. You can restrict the
use of the SSH keypair by prepending a forced command to the SSH public key in
the remote server's `authorized_keys` file. This example will start |project_name|
in server mode and limit it to a specific filesystem path::

  command="borg serve --restrict-to-path /path/to/repo",restrict ssh-rsa AAAAB3[...]

If it is not possible to install |project_name| on the remote host,
it is still possible to use the remote host to store a repository by
mounting the remote filesystem, for example, using sshfs::

  $ sshfs user@hostname:/path/to /path/to
  $ borg init /path/to/repo
  $ fusermount -u /path/to

You can also use other remote filesystems in a similar way. Just be careful,
not all filesystems out there are really stable and working good enough to
be acceptable for backup usage.
