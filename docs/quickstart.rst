Quick Start
===========

This chapter will get you started with Borg and covers various use cases.

A step-by-step example
----------------------

.. include:: quickstart_example.rst.inc

Archives and repositories
-------------------------

A *Borg archive* is the result of a single backup (``borg create``). An archive
stores a snapshot of the data of the files "inside" it. One can later extract or
mount an archive to restore from a backup.

*Repositories* are filesystem directories acting as self-contained stores of archives.
Repositories can be accessed locally via path or remotely via SSH. Under the hood,
repositories contain data blocks and a manifest that tracks which blocks are in each
archive. If some data hasn't changed between backups, Borg simply
references an already-uploaded data chunk (deduplication).

.. _about_free_space:

Important note about free space
-------------------------------

Before you start creating backups, ensure that there is *always* plenty
of free space on the destination filesystem that has your backup repository
(and also on ~/.cache). A few GB should suffice for most hard-drive sized
repositories. See also :ref:`cache-memory-usage`.

If you do run out of disk space, it can be hard or impossible to free space,
because Borg needs free space to operate - even to delete backup archives.

You can use some monitoring process or just include the free space information
in your backup log files (you check them regularly anyway, right?).

Also helpful:

- use `borg repo-space` to reserve some disk space that can be freed when the filesystem
  does not have free space any more.
- if you use LVM: use a LV + a filesystem that you can resize later and have
  some unallocated PEs you can add to the LV.
- consider using quotas (e.g. fs quota, quota settings of storage provider)
- use `prune` and `compact` regularly


Important note about permissions
--------------------------------

To avoid permission issues (in your borg repository or borg cache), **always
access the repository using the same user account**.

If you want to back up files of other users or the operating system, running
borg as root likely will be required (otherwise you get `Permission denied`
errors).
If you only back up your own files, run it as your normal user (i.e. not root).

For a local repository always use the same user to invoke borg.

For a remote repository: always use e.g., ssh://borg@remote_host. You can use this
from different local users; the remote user running borg and accessing the
repo will always be `borg`.

If you need to access a local repository from different users, you can use the
same method by using ssh to borg@localhost.

Important note about files changing during the backup process
-------------------------------------------------------------

Borg does not do anything about the internal consistency of the data
it backs up.  It just reads and backs up each file in whatever state
that file is when Borg gets to it.  On an active system, this can lead
to two kinds of inconsistency:

- By the time Borg backs up a file, it might have changed since the backup process was initiated
- A file could change while Borg is backing it up, making the file internally inconsistent

If you have a set of files and want to ensure that they are backed up
in a specific or consistent state, you must take steps to prevent
changes to those files during the backup process.  There are a few
common techniques to achieve this.

- Avoid running any programs that might change the files.

- Snapshot files, filesystems, container storage volumes, or logical volumes.
  LVM or ZFS might be useful here.

- Dump databases or stop the database servers.

- Shut down virtual machines before backing up their disk image files.

- Shut down containers before backing up their storage volumes.

For some systems, Borg might work well enough without these
precautions.  If you are simply backing up the files on a system that
isn't very active (e.g. in a typical home directory), Borg usually
works well enough without further care for consistency.  Log files and
caches might not be in a perfect state, but this is rarely a problem.

For databases, virtual machines, and containers, there are specific
techniques for backing them up that do not simply use Borg to back up
the underlying filesystem.  For databases, check your database
documentation for techniques that will save the database state between
transactions.  For virtual machines, consider running the backup on
the VM itself or mounting the filesystem while the VM is shut down.
For Docker containers, perhaps docker's "save" command can help.

Automating backups
------------------

The following example script is meant to be run daily by the ``root`` user on
different local machines. It backs up a machine's important files (but not the
complete operating system) to a repository ``~/backup/main``  on a remote server.
Some files which aren't necessarily needed in this backup are excluded. See
:ref:`borg_patterns` on how to add more exclude options.

After the backup, this script also uses the :ref:`borg_prune` subcommand to keep
a certain number of old archives and deletes the others.

Finally, it uses the :ref:`borg_compact` subcommand to remove deleted objects
from the segment files in the repository to free disk space.

Before running, make sure that the repository is initialized as documented in
:ref:`remote_repos` and that the script has the correct permissions to be executable
by the root user, but not executable or readable by anyone else, i.e. root:root 0700.

You can use this script as a starting point and modify it where it's necessary to fit
your setup.

Do not forget to test your created backups to make sure everything you need is
backed up and that the ``prune`` command keeps and deletes the correct backups.

    else
        info "Backup, Prune, and/or Compact finished with errors"
    fi

    exit ${global_exit}

Pitfalls with shell variables and environment variables
-------------------------------------------------------

This applies to all environment variables you want Borg to see, not just
``BORG_PASSPHRASE``. TL;DR: always ``export`` your variable,
and use single quotes if you're unsure of the details of your shell's expansion
behavior. E.g.::

    export BORG_PASSPHRASE='complicated & long'

This is because ``export`` exposes variables to subprocesses, which Borg may be
one of. More on ``export`` can be found in the "ENVIRONMENT" section of the
bash(1) man page.

Beware of how ``sudo`` interacts with environment variables. For example, you
may be surprised that the following ``export`` has no effect on your command::

   export BORG_PASSPHRASE='complicated & long'
   sudo ./yourborgwrapper.sh  # still prompts for password

For more information, refer to the sudo(8) man page and ``env_keep`` in
the sudoers(5) man page.

.. Tip::
    To debug what your borg process sees, find its PID
    (``ps aux|grep borg``) and then look into ``/proc/<PID>/environ``.

.. passphrase_notes:

Passphrase notes
----------------

If you use encryption (or authentication), Borg will ask you interactively
for a passphrase to encrypt/decrypt the keyfile / repokey.

A passphrase should be a single line of text. Any trailing linefeed will be
stripped.

Do not use empty passphrases, as these can be trivially guessed, which does not
leave any encrypted data secure.

Avoid passphrases containing non-ASCII characters.
Borg can process any unicode text, but problems may arise at input due to text
encoding or differing keyboard layouts, so best just avoid non-ASCII stuff.

See: https://xkcd.com/936/

If you want to automate, you can supply the passphrase
directly or indirectly with the use of environment variables.

Supply a passphrase directly::

    # use this passphrase (use safe permissions on the script!):
    export BORG_PASSPHRASE='my super secret passphrase'

Or delegate to an external program to supply the passphrase::

    # use the "pass" password manager to get the passphrase:
    export BORG_PASSCOMMAND='pass show backup'

    # use GPG to get the passphrase contained in a gpg-encrypted file:
    export BORG_PASSCOMMAND='gpg --decrypt borg-passphrase.gpg'

Or read the passphrase from an open file descriptor::

    export BORG_PASSPHRASE_FD=42

Using hardware crypto devices (like Nitrokey, Yubikey and others) is not
directly supported by borg, but you can use these indirectly.
E.g. if your crypto device supports GPG and borg calls ``gpg`` via
``BORG_PASSCOMMAND``, it should just work.

.. backup_compression:

Backup compression
------------------

The default is lz4 (very fast, but low compression ratio), but other methods are
supported for different situations. Compression not only helps you save disk space,
but will especially speed up remote backups since less data needs to be transferred.

zstd is a modern compression algorithm which can be parametrized to anything between
N=1 for highest speed (and relatively low compression) to N=22 for highest compression
(and lower speed)::

    $ borg create --compression zstd,N arch ~

If you have a fast repo storage and you want minimum CPU usage you can disable
compression::

    $ borg create --compression none arch ~

You can also use zlib and lzma instead of zstd, although zstd usually provides the
the best compression for a given resource consumption. Please see :ref:`borg_compression`
for all options.

An interesting alternative is ``auto``, which first checks with lz4 whether a chunk is
compressible (that check is very fast), and only if it is, compresses it with the
specified algorithm::

    $ borg create --compression auto,zstd,7 arch ~

You'll need to experiment a bit to find the best compression for your use case.
Keep an eye on CPU load and throughput.

.. _encrypted_repos:

Repository encryption
---------------------

You can choose the repository encryption mode at repository creation time::

    $ borg repo-create --encryption=MODE

For a list of available encryption MODEs and their descriptions, please refer
to :ref:`borg_repo-create`.

If you use encryption, all data is encrypted on the client before being written
to the repository.
This means that an attacker who manages to compromise the host containing an
encrypted repository will not be able to access any of the data, even while the
backup is being made.

Key material is stored in encrypted form and can be only decrypted by providing
the correct passphrase.

For automated backups the passphrase can be specified using the
`BORG_PASSPHRASE` environment variable.

.. note:: Be careful about how you set that environment, see
          :ref:`this note about password environments <password_env>`
          for more information.

.. warning:: The repository data is totally inaccessible without the key
    and the key passphrase.

    Make a backup copy of the key file (``keyfile`` mode) or repo config
    file (``repokey`` mode) and keep it at a safe place, so you still have
    the key in case it gets corrupted or lost. Also keep your passphrase
    at a safe place. You can make backups using :ref:`borg_key_export`
    subcommand.

    If you want to print a backup of your key to paper use the ``--paper``
    option of this command and print the result, or print this `template`_
    if you need a version with QR-Code.

    A backup inside of the backup that is encrypted with that key/passphrase
    won't help you with that, of course.

.. _template: paperkey.html

.. _remote_repos:

Remote repositories
-------------------

Borg can initialize and access repositories on remote hosts if the
host is accessible using SSH.  This is fastest and easiest when Borg
is installed on the remote host, in which case the following syntax is used::

  $ borg -r ssh://user@hostname:port/path/to/repo repo-create ...

Note: Please see the usage chapter for a full documentation of repo URLs. Also
see :ref:`ssh_configuration` for recommended settings to avoid disconnects and hangs.

Remote operations over SSH can be automated with SSH keys. You can restrict the
use of the SSH keypair by prepending a forced command to the SSH public key in
the remote server's `authorized_keys` file. This example will start Borg
in server mode and limit it to a specific filesystem path::

  command="borg serve --restrict-to-path /path/to/repo",restrict ssh-rsa AAAAB3[...]

If it is not possible to install Borg on the remote host,
it is still possible to use the remote host to store a repository by
mounting the remote filesystem, for example, using sshfs::

  $ sshfs user@hostname:/path/to /path/to
  $ borg -r /path/to/repo repo-create ...
  $ fusermount -u /path/to

You can also use other remote filesystems in a similar way. Just be careful,
not all filesystems out there are really stable and working good enough to
be acceptable for backup usage.

Other kinds of repositories
---------------------------

Due to using the `borgstore` project, borg now also supports other kinds of
(remote) repositories besides `file:` and `ssh:`:

- sftp: the borg client will directly talk to an sftp server.
  This does not require borg being installed on the sftp server.
- rclone: the borg client will talk via rclone to cloud storage.
- Others may come in the future, adding backends to `borgstore` is rather simple.

Restoring a backup
------------------

Please note that we describe only the most basic commands and options
here. Refer to the command reference to see more.

To restore, work **on the same machine as the same user**
that was used to create the backups of the wanted files. Doing so
avoids issues such as:

- confusion relating to paths
- mapping of user/group names to user/group IDs
- permissions

You likely already have a working borg setup there, including perhaps:

  - an environment variable for the key passphrase (for encrypted repos),
  - a keyfile for the repo (not needed for repokey mode),
  - a ssh key for the repo server (not needed for locally mounted repos),
  - a valid borg cache for that repo (quicker than cache rebuild).

The **user** might be:

- root (if full backups, backups including system stuff or multiple
  users' files were made)
- some specific user using sudo to execute borg as root
- some specific user (if backups of that user's files were made)

A borg **backup repository** can be either:

- in a local directory (like e.g. a locally mounted USB disk)
- on a remote backup server machine that is reachable via ssh (client/server)

If the repository is encrypted, you will also need the **key** and the **passphrase**
(which is protecting the key).

The **key** can be located:

- in the repository (**repokey** mode).

  Easy, this will usually "just work".
- in the home directory of the user who made the backup (**keyfile** mode).

  This may cause a bit more effort:

  - if you have just lost that home directory and you first need to restore the
    borg key (e.g. from the separate backup you made of it or from another
    user or machine accessing the same repository).
  - if you first must find out the correct machine / user / home directory
    (where the borg client was run to make the backups).

The **passphrase** for the key has been either:

- entered interactively at backup time
  (not practical if backup is automated / unattended).
- acquired via some environment variable driven mechanism in the backup script
  (look there for BORG_PASSPHRASE, BORG_PASSCOMMAND, etc. and just do it like
  that).

There are **2 ways to restore** files from a borg backup repository:

- **borg mount** - use this if:

  - you don't know exactly which files you want to restore
  - you don't know which archive contains the files (in the state) you want
  - you need to look into files / directories before deciding what you want
  - you need a relatively low volume of data restored
  - you don't care for restoring stuff that FUSE mount does not implement yet
    (like special fs flags, ACLs)
  - you have a client with good resources (RAM, CPU, temporary disk space)
  - you would rather use some filemanager to restore (copy) files than borg
    extract shell commands

- **borg extract** - use this if:

  - you know precisely what you want (repo, archive, path)
  - you need a high volume of files restored (best speed)
  - you want a as-complete-as-it-gets reproduction of file metadata
    (like special fs flags, ACLs)
  - you have a client with low resources (RAM, CPU, temp. disk space)


Example with **borg mount**:

::

    # open a new, separate terminal (this terminal will be blocked until umount)

    # now we find out the archive ID of the archive we want to mount:
    borg repo-list

    # mount one archive giving its archive ID prefix:
    borg mount -a aid:d34db33f /mnt/borg

    # alternatively, mount all archives from a borg repo (slower):
    borg mount /mnt/borg

    # it may take a while until you will see stuff in /mnt/borg.

    # now use another terminal or file browser and look into /mnt/borg.
    # when finished, umount to unlock the repo and unblock the terminal:
    borg umount /mnt/borg


Example with **borg extract**:

::

    # borg extract always extracts into current directory and that directory
    # should be empty (borg does not support transforming a non-empty dir to
    # the state as present in your backup archive).
    mkdir borg_restore
    cd borg_restore

    # now we find out the archive ID of the archive we want to extract:
    borg repo-list

    # find out how the paths stored in the the archive look like:
    borg list aid:d34db33f

    # we extract only some specific path (note: no leading / !):
    borg extract aid:d34db33f path/to/extract

    # alternatively, we could fully extract the archive:
    borg extract aid:d34db33f

    # now move the files to the correct place...


Difference when using a **remote borg backup server**:

It is basically all the same as with the local repository, but you need to
refer to the repo using a ``ssh://`` URL.

In the given example, ``borg`` is the user name used to log into the machine
``backup.example.org`` which runs ssh on port ``2222`` and has the borg repo
in ``/path/to/repo``.

Instead of giving a FQDN or a hostname, you can also give an IP address.

As usual, you either need a password to log in or the backup server might
have authentication set up via ssh ``authorized_keys`` (which is likely the
case if unattended, automated backups were done).

::

    borg -r ssh://borg@backup.example.org:2222/path/to/repo mount /mnt/borg
    # or
    borg -r ssh://borg@backup.example.org:2222/path/to/repo extract archive
