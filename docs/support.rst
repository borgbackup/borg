Support
=======

Please first read the docs, the existing issue tracker issues and mailing
list posts -- a lot of stuff is already documented / explained / discussed /
filed there.

Issue Tracker
-------------

If you've found a bug or have a concrete feature request, please create a new
ticket on the project's `issue tracker`_.

For more general questions or discussions, IRC or mailing list are preferred.

IRC
---
Join us on channel #borgbackup on chat.freenode.net.

As usual on IRC, just ask or tell directly and then patiently wait for replies.
Stay connected.

Mailing list
------------

To find out about the mailing list, its topic, how to subscribe, how to
unsubscribe and where you can find the archives of the list, see the
`mailing list homepage
<https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/borgbackup>`_.

Bounties and Fundraisers
------------------------

We use `BountySource <https://www.bountysource.com/teams/borgbackup>`_ to allow
monetary contributions to the project and the developers, who push it forward.

There, you can give general funds to the borgbackup members (the developers will
then spend the funds as they deem fit). If you do not have some specific bounty
(see below), you can use this as a general way to say "Thank You!" and support
the software / project you like.

If you want to encourage developers to fix some specific issue or implement some
specific feature suggestion, you can post a new bounty or back an existing one
(they always refer to an issue in our `issue tracker`_).

As a developer, you can become a Bounty Hunter and win bounties (earn money) by
contributing to |project_name|, a free and open source software project.

We might also use BountySource to fund raise for some bigger goals.
