Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This command finds differences (file contents, user/group/mode) between archives.

A repository location and an archive name must be specified for REPO_ARCHIVE1.
ARCHIVE2 is just another archive name in same repository (no repository location
allowed).

For archives created with Borg 1.1 or newer diff automatically detects whether
the archives are created with the same chunker params. If so, only chunk IDs
are compared, which is very fast.

For archives prior to Borg 1.1 chunk contents are compared by default.
If you did not create the archives with different chunker params,
pass --same-chunker-params.
Note that the chunker params changed from Borg 0.xx to 1.0.

See the output of the "borg help patterns" command for more help on exclude patterns.
