Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This command extracts the contents of an archive. By default the entire
archive is extracted but a subset of files and directories can be selected
by passing a list of ``PATHs`` as arguments. The file selection can further
be restricted by using the ``--exclude`` option.

See the output of the "borg help patterns" command for more help on exclude patterns.

By using ``--dry-run``, you can do all extraction steps except actually writing the
output data: reading metadata and data chunks from the repo, checking the hash/hmac,
decrypting, decompressing.
