Return codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Borg can exit with the following return codes (rc):

=========== =======
Return code Meaning
=========== =======
0           success (logged as INFO)
1           generic warning (operation reached its normal end, but there were warnings â€”
            you should check the log; logged as WARNING)
2           generic error (like a fatal error or a local/remote exception; the operation
            did not reach its normal end; logged as ERROR)
3..99       specific error (enabled by BORG_EXIT_CODES=modern)
100..127    specific warning (enabled by BORG_EXIT_CODES=modern)
128+N       killed by signal N (e.g. 137 == kill -9)
=========== =======

If you use ``--show-rc``, the return code is also logged at the indicated
level as the last log entry.

The modern exit codes (return codes, "rc") are documented here: see :ref:`msgid`.
