    borg list <options> REPOSITORY_OR_ARCHIVE PATH

positional arguments
    REPOSITORY_OR_ARCHIVE
        repository/archive to list contents of
    PATH
        paths to list; patterns are supported

optional arguments
    ``--short``
        | only print file/directory names, nothing else
    ``--format``, ``--list-format``
        | specify format for file listing
        |                                 (default: "{mode} {user:6} {group:6} {size:8d} {isomtime} {path}{extra}{NL}")
    ``--json``
        | format output as JSON. The form of --format is ignored, but keys used in it are added to the JSON output. Some keys are always present. Note: JSON can only represent text. A "bpath" key is therefore not available.

filters
    ``-P``, ``--prefix``
        | only consider archive names starting with this prefix
    ``--sort-by``

    ``--first N``
        | consider first N archives after other filters were applied
    ``--last N``
