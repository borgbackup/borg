Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This command mounts an archive as a FUSE filesystem. This can be useful for
browsing an archive or restoring individual files. Unless the ``--foreground``
option is given the command will run in the background until the filesystem
is ``umounted``.

The command ``borgfs`` provides a wrapper for ``borg mount``. This can also be
used in fstab entries:
``/path/to/repo /mnt/point fuse.borgfs defaults,noauto 0 0``

To allow a regular user to use fstab entries, add the ``user`` option:
``/path/to/repo /mnt/point fuse.borgfs defaults,noauto,user 0 0``

For mount options, see the fuse(8) manual page. Additional mount options
supported by borg:

- versions: when used with a repository mount, this gives a merged, versioned
  view of the files in the archives. EXPERIMENTAL, layout may change in future.
- allow_damaged_files: by default damaged files (where missing chunks were
  replaced with runs of zeros by borg check --repair) are not readable and
  return EIO (I/O error). Set this option to read such files.

The BORG_MOUNT_DATA_CACHE_ENTRIES environment variable is meant for advanced users
to tweak the performance. It sets the number of cached data chunks; additional
memory usage can be up to ~8 MiB times this number. The default is the number
of CPU cores.
