Upgrading a passphrase encrypted attic repo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

attic offered a "passphrase" encryption mode, but this was removed in borg 1.0
and replaced by the "repokey" mode (which stores the passphrase-protected
encryption key into the repository config).

Thus, to upgrade a "passphrase" attic repo to a "repokey" borg repo, 2 steps
are needed, in this order:

- borg upgrade repo
- borg key migrate-to-repokey repo
