"        Exclude patterns use a variant of shell pattern syntax, with '*' "
"matching any\n"
"        number of characters, '?' matching any single character, '[...]' "
"matching any\n"
"        single character specified, including ranges, and '[!...]' matching "
"any\n"
"        character not specified.  For the purpose of these patterns, the "
"path\n"
"        separator ('\\' for Windows and '/' on other systems) is not "
"treated\n"
"        specially.  For a path to match a pattern, it must completely match "
"from\n"
"        start to end, or must match from the start to just before a path "
"separator.\n"
"        Except for the root path, paths will never end in the path separator "
"when\n"
"        matching is attempted.  Thus, if a given pattern ends in a path "
"separator, a\n"
"        '*' is appended before matching is attempted.  Patterns with "
"wildcards should\n"
"        be quoted to protect them from shell expansion.\n"
"\n"
"        Examples:\n"
"\n"
"        # Exclude '/home/user/file.o' but not '/home/user/file.odt':\n"
"        $ borg create -e '*.o' backup /\n"
"\n"
"        # Exclude '/home/user/junk' and '/home/user/subdir/junk' but\n"
"        # not '/home/user/importantjunk' or '/etc/junk':\n"
"        $ borg create -e '/home/*/junk' backup /\n"
"\n"
"        # Exclude the contents of '/home/user/cache' but not the directory "
"itself:\n"
"        $ borg create -e /home/user/cache/ backup /\n"

"        The check command verifies the consistency of a repository and the "
"corresponding archives.\n"
"\n"
"        First, the underlying repository data files are checked:\n"
"\n"
"        - For all segments the segment magic (header) is checked\n"
"        - For all objects stored in the segments, all metadata (e.g. crc and "
"size) and\n"
"          all data is read. The read data is checked by size and CRC. Bit "
"rot and other\n"
"          types of accidental damage can be detected this way.\n"
"        - If we are in repair mode and a integrity error is detected for a "
"segment,\n"
"          we try to recover as many objects from the segment as possible.\n"
"        - In repair mode, it makes sure that the index is consistent with "
"the data\n"
"          stored in the segments.\n"
"        - If you use a remote repo server via ssh:, the repo check is "
"executed on the\n"
"          repo server without causing significant network traffic.\n"
"        - The repository check can be skipped using the --archives-only "
"option.\n"
"\n"
"        Second, the consistency and correctness of the archive metadata is "
"verified:\n"
"\n"
"        - Is the repo manifest present? If not, it is rebuilt from archive "
"metadata\n"
"          chunks (this requires reading and decrypting of all metadata and "
"data).\n"
"        - Check if archive metadata chunk is present. if not, remove archive "
"from\n"
"          manifest.\n"
"        - For all files (items) in the archive, for all chunks referenced by "
"these\n"
"          files, check if chunk is present (if not and we are in repair "
"mode, replace\n"
"          it with a same-size chunk of zeros). This requires reading of "
"archive and\n"
"          file metadata, but not data.\n"
"        - If we are in repair mode and we checked all the archives: delete "
"orphaned\n"
"          chunks from the repo.\n"
"        - if you use a remote repo server via ssh:, the archive check is "
"executed on\n"
"          the client machine (because if encryption is enabled, the checks "
"will require\n"
"          decryption and this is always done client-side, because key access "
"will be\n"
"          required).\n"
"        - The archive checks can be time consuming, they can be skipped "
"using the\n"
"          --repository-only option.\n"

"        The prune command prunes a repository by deleting archives not "
"matching\n"
"        any of the specified retention options. This command is normally "
"used by\n"
"        automated backup scripts wanting to keep a certain number of "
"historic backups.\n"
"\n"
"        As an example, \"-d 7\" means to keep the latest backup on each day "
"for 7 days.\n"
"        Days without backups do not count towards the total.\n"
"        The rules are applied from hourly to yearly, and backups selected by "
"previous\n"
"        rules do not count towards those of later rules. The time that each "
"backup\n"
"        completes is used for pruning purposes. Dates and times are "
"interpreted in\n"
"        the local timezone, and weeks go from Monday to Sunday. Specifying "
"a\n"
"        negative number of archives to keep means that there is no limit.\n"
"\n"
"        The \"--keep-within\" option takes an argument of the form "
"\"<int><char>\",\n"
"        where char is \"H\", \"d\", \"w\", \"m\", \"y\". For example, \"--"
"keep-within 2d\" means\n"
"        to keep all archives that were created within the past 48 hours.\n"
"        \"1m\" is taken to mean \"31d\". The archives kept with this option "
"do not\n"

"\n"
"        If a prefix is set with -p, then only archives that start with the "
"prefix are\n"

"totals\n"
"        specified by the rules.\n"
