/* Notice extracted from xxHash homepage:

xxHash is an extremely fast hash algorithm, running at RAM speed limits.
It also successfully passes all tests from the SMHasher suite.

Q.Score is a measure of quality of the hash function.
It depends on successfully passing SMHasher test set.
10 is a perfect score.

Note: SMHasher's CRC32 implementation is not the fastest one.
Other speed-oriented implementations can be faster,
especially in combination with PCLMUL instruction:

A 64-bit version, named XXH64, is available since r35.
It offers much better speed, but for 64-bit applications only.

*  XXH3
*  New experimental hash
************************************************************************/

/* ************************************************************************
 * XXH3 is a new hash algorithm featuring:
 *  - Improved speed for both small and large inputs
 *  - True 64-bit and 128-bit outputs
 *  - SIMD acceleration
 *  - Improved 32-bit viability
 *
 * Speed analysis methodology is explained here:
 *
 *    https://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html
 *
 * In general, expect XXH3 to run about ~2x faster on large inputs and >3x
 * faster on small ones compared to XXH64, though exact differences depend on
 * the platform.
 *
 * The algorithm is portable: Like XXH32 and XXH64, it generates the same hash
 * on all platforms.
 *
 * It benefits greatly from SIMD and 64-bit arithmetic, but does not require it.
 *
 * Almost all 32-bit and 64-bit targets that can run XXH32 smoothly can run
 * XXH3 at competitive speeds, even if XXH64 runs slowly. Further details are
 * explained in the implementation.
 *
 * Optimized implementations are provided for AVX512, AVX2, SSE2, NEON, POWER8,
 * ZVector and scalar targets. This can be controlled with the XXH_VECTOR macro.
 *
 * XXH3 offers 2 variants, _64bits and _128bits.
 * When only 64 bits are needed, prefer calling the _64bits variant, as it
 * reduces the amount of mixing, resulting in faster speed on small inputs.
 *
 * It's also generally simpler to manipulate a scalar return type than a struct.
 *
 * The 128-bit version adds additional strength, but it is slightly slower.
 *
 * The XXH3 algorithm is still in development.
 * The results it produces may still change in future versions.
 *
 * Results produced by v0.7.x are not comparable with results from v0.7.y.
 * However, the API is completely stable, and it can safely be used for
 * ephemeral data (local sessions).
 *
 * Avoid storing values in long-term storage until the algorithm is finalized.
 * XXH3's return values will be officially finalized upon reaching v0.8.0.
 *
 * After which, return values of XXH3 and XXH128 will no longer change in
 * future versions.
 *
 * The API supports one-shot hashing, streaming mode, and custom secrets.

 *
 * The below switch allow to select a different access method for improved

 * Method 0 (default):
 *     Use `memcpy()`. Safe and portable.
 * Method 1:
 *     `__attribute__((packed))` statement. It depends on compiler extensions
 *     and is therefore not portable.
 *     This method is safe if your compiler supports it, and *generally* as
 *     fast or faster than `memcpy`.
 * Method 2:
 *     Direct access via cast. This method doesn't depend on the compiler but
 *     violates the C standard.
 *     It can generate buggy code on targets which do not support unaligned
 *     memory accesses.
 *     But in some circumstances, it's the only known way to get the most
 *     performance (ie GCC + ARMv6)
 * Method 3:
 *     Byteshift. This can generate the best code on old compilers which don't
 *     inline small `memcpy()` calls, and it might also be faster on big-endian
 *     systems which lack a native byteswap instruction.
 * See https://stackoverflow.com/a/32095106/646947 for details.

     * UGLY HACK:
     * This inline assembly hack forces acc into a normal register. This is the
     * only thing that prevents GCC and Clang from autovectorizing the XXH32
     * loop (pragmas and attributes don't work for some resason) without globally
     * disabling SSE4.1.
     *
     * The reason we want to avoid vectorization is because despite working on
     * 4 integers at a time, there are multiple factors slowing XXH32 down on
     * SSE4:
     * - There's a ridiculous amount of lag from pmulld (10 cycles of latency on
     *   newer chips!) making it slightly slower to multiply four integers at
     *   once compared to four integers independently. Even when pmulld was
     *   fastest, Sandy/Ivy Bridge, it is still not worth it to go into SSE
     *   just to multiply unless doing a long operation.
     *
     * - Four instructions are required to rotate,
     *      movqda tmp,  v // not required with VEX encoding
     *      pslld  tmp, 13 // tmp <<= 13
     *      psrld  v,   19 // x >>= 19
     *      por    v,  tmp // x |= tmp
     *   compared to one for scalar:
     *      roll   v, 13    // reliably fast across the board
     *      shldl  v, v, 13 // Sandy Bridge and later prefer this for some reason
     *
     * - Instruction level parallelism is actually more beneficial here because
     *   the SIMD actually serializes this operation: While v1 is rotating, v2
     *   can load data, while v3 can multiply. SSE forces them to operate
     *   together.
     *
     * How this hack works:
     * __asm__(""       // Declare an assembly block but don't declare any instructions
     *          :       // However, as an Input/Output Operand,
     *          "+r"    // constrain a read/write operand (+) as a general purpose register (r).
     *          (acc)   // and set acc as the operand
     * );
     *
     * Because of the 'r', the compiler has promised that seed will be in a
     * general purpose register and the '+' says that it will be 'read/write',
     * so it has to assume it has changed. It is like volatile without all the
     * loads and stores.
     *
     * Since the argument has to be in a normal register (not an SSE register),
     * each time XXH32_round is called, it is impossible to vectorize.
