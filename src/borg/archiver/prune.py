        The prune command prunes a repository by deleting all archives not matching
        any of the specified retention options.

        Important: Repository disk space is **not** freed until you run ``borg compact``.

        This command is normally used by automated backup scripts wanting to keep a
        certain number of historic backups. This retention policy is commonly referred to as
        `GFS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_rotation_scheme#Grandfather-father-son>`_
        (Grandfather-father-son) backup rotation scheme.

        Also, prune automatically removes checkpoint archives (incomplete archives left
        behind by interrupted backup runs) except if the checkpoint is the latest
        archive (and thus still needed). Checkpoint archives are not considered when
        comparing archive counts against the retention limits (``--keep-X``).

        If a prefix is set with -P, then only archives that start with the prefix are
        considered for deletion and only those archives count towards the totals
        specified by the rules.
        Otherwise, *all* archives in the repository are candidates for deletion!
        There is no automatic distinction between archives representing different
        contents. These need to be distinguished by specifying matching prefixes.

        If you have multiple sequences of archives with different data sets (e.g.
        from different machines) in one shared repository, use one prune call per
        data set that matches only the respective archives using the -P option.

        The ``--keep-within`` option takes an argument of the form "<int><char>",
        where char is "H", "d", "w", "m", "y". For example, ``--keep-within 2d`` means
        to keep all archives that were created within the past 48 hours.
        "1m" is taken to mean "31d". The archives kept with this option do not
        count towards the totals specified by any other options.

        A good procedure is to thin out more and more the older your backups get.
        As an example, ``--keep-daily 7`` means to keep the latest backup on each day,
        up to 7 most recent days with backups (days without backups do not count).
        The rules are applied from secondly to yearly, and backups selected by previous
        rules do not count towards those of later rules. The time that each backup
        starts is used for pruning purposes. Dates and times are interpreted in
        the local timezone, and weeks go from Monday to Sunday. Specifying a
        negative number of archives to keep means that there is no limit. As of borg
        1.2.0, borg will retain the oldest archive if any of the secondly, minutely,
        hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly rules was not otherwise able to meet
        its retention target. This enables the first chronological archive to continue
        aging until it is replaced by a newer archive that meets the retention criteria.

        The ``--keep-last N`` option is doing the same as ``--keep-secondly N`` (and it will
        keep the last N archives under the assumption that you do not create more than one
        backup archive in the same second).

        When using ``--stats``, you will get some statistics about how much data was
        deleted - the "Deleted data" deduplicated size there is most interesting as
        that is how much your repository will shrink.
        Please note that the "All archives" stats refer to the state after pruning.
