The global exit_code variable is used so that modules other than archiver can increase the program exit code if a
warning or error occurred during their operation. This is different from archiver.exit_code, which is only accessible
from the archiver object.

Note: keep this in helpers/__init__.py as the code expects to be able to assign to helpers.exit_code.
