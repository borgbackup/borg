    A file class that is supposed to enable write ordering (one way or another) and data durability after close().

    The degree to which either is possible varies with operating system, filesystem, and hardware.

    This fallback implements a naive and slow way of doing this. On some operating systems it can't actually
    guarantee any of the above, since fsync() doesn't guarantee it. Furthermore it may not be possible at all
    to satisfy the above guarantees on some hardware or operating systems. In these cases we hope that the thorough
    checksumming implemented catches any corrupted data due to misordered, delayed or partial writes.

    Note that POSIX doesn't specify anything about power failures (or similar failures). A system that
    routinely loses files or corrupts files on power loss is POSIX-compliant.

    Calling SyncFile(path) for an existing path will raise FileExistsError. See the comment in __init__.
